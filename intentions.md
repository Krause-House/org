# Intentions
Here are a list of intentions we have as a DAO and directions we'd like to move in.

#### Avoiding Single Choice Voting
Proposals will no longer use Single Choice Voting which requires a wallet to place their entire token balance into a vote. Weâ€™ll begin to use voting strategies that allow for a wallet to allocate weighting to their vote (such as Weighted Voting). This is similar to how other prominent social DAOs such as CabinDAO reduce this issue for their communities.
