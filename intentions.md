# Intentions

Here are a list of intentions we have as a DAO and directions we'd like to move in.

#### Avoiding Single Choice Voting

Single Choice Voting requires a wallet to place their entire token balance into a single outcome. We intend begin to experiment with alternative voting strategies that allow for a wallet to allocate weighting to their vote (such as Weighted Voting). This is similar to how other prominent social DAOs such as CabinDAO reduce this issue for their communities.
