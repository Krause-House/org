### How do I suggest a change to governance?

Proposed changes will be sent to Snapshot for voting. For that proposal, you will need an updated representation of governance.

There's a few ways to do that:

1. Recommended: Fork this Github repository, make desired edits, and link to the specific git commit. Think of a git commit as a snapshot or freeze frame of a project at some point in time. This is **crucial**, as the DAO is only agreeing to that specific "snap"/commit, and _not_ to any future changes that may occur on that project.
2. Publish a document on IPFS, and provide a link to that. IPFS links, like git commits, are "frozen", meaning they cannot be updated after the fact.
