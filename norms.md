# Norms
#### Community Guidelines

#### Self Voting
We discourage voting on proposals with direct financial benefit to oneself.  In egregious cases, the Multisig Team is encourages to reject processing transactions related to that proposal.

#### Contributor Payout Flow
Contributors submit payout requests to Utopia, and payments are processed on the 1st and 15th.

#### Proposal Vetting
The Stewards Team is responsible for ensuring all proposals put to vote are valid.  Invalid proposals are where a proposal appears to be malicious, poorly scoped, unclear, or misaligned with Krause House's priorities. In the case of an invalid proposal, the Stewards Team has the right to withold the proposal for a vote until the proposal's faults have been resolved. A well functioning Stewards Team is helping the community turn ideas into proposals, regardless of their personal voting preference â€” assuming the propsal is well intended.
