#### Community Guidelines

#### Self Voting
We discourage voting on proposals with direct financial benefit to oneself.  In egregious cases, the Multisig Team is encourages to reject processing transactions related to that proposal.

#### Contributor Payout Flow
Contributors submit payout requests to Utopia, and payments are processed on the 1st and 15th.

#### Proposal Vetting
The Stewards Team is responsible for vetting proposals.  They have full jurisdiction to reject any proposal for any reason; however, they are meant to help Jerry's construct proposals whether they are for or against that proposal.  That being said, in cases where proposals appear malicious, poorly constructed, unclear, or misaligned with Krause House's priorities, they are encouraged to reject it.
