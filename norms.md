# Norms

### $KRAUSE Holders

$KRAUSE represents governance weight.

1. Vote on Snapshot Proposals (1 $KRAUSE = 1 vote)

### Ticket (NFT) Holders

Tickets represent membership.

1. Access to Discord and other member platforms.
2. Ability to submit [proposal](./proposals/process.md).

#### Community Guidelines

#### Self Voting

We discourage voting on proposals with direct financial benefit to oneself. In egregious cases, the Multisig Team is encourages to reject processing transactions related to that proposal.

#### Contributor Payout Flow

Contributors submit payout requests to Utopia, and payments are processed on the 1st and 15th.

#### Proposal Vetting

The Stewards Team is responsible for ensuring all proposals put to vote are valid. Invalid proposals are where a proposal appears to be malicious, poorly scoped, unclear, or misaligned with Krause House's priorities. In the case of an invalid proposal, the Stewards Team has the right to withold the proposal for a vote until the proposal's faults have been resolved. A well functioning Stewards Team is helping the community turn ideas into proposals, regardless of their personal voting preference â€” assuming the propsal is well intended.

#### Guest Passes

Guest Passes are intended to be issued to people who want to contribute, but are unable to afford an NFT. Guest passes should be revoked when that contributor no longer needs access to do their work.
