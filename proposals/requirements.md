### Proposal Requirements / "Proposal Checklist"

#### Proposal must contain _one_ "atomic" change.

Changes should be approved _atomically_ such that undesirable changes cannot be "snuck in" as part of a "net positive" change.

#### Proposal updating the org must provide an IPFS link or git commit hash to the proposed DAO state.

It is essential that the data at the link cannt be changed after the DAO approves it. The DAO must vote on some specific "state" of a document, like a git commit hash or an IPFS link.

#### Proposals must provide clear action steps to Multisig if action is needed.

#### Proposals cannot force another person to take any action unless they've opted in (ex: Can force multisig signers to take action, or a social media manager to post/remove some content.)
