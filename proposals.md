# Proposals

### What can proposals do?
Proposals are an update on the DAO State document (this).  Here are some things that proposals can do:
1. Request/allocate Treasury funds.
2. Alter [Permissions Roster](./permissions).
3. Adding, removing, updating [norms](./norms.md)
4. Update DAO State in any other way.

### Proposal Process
1. Any NFT holder can submit a proposal to Stewards Team.
2. Stewards Team decides what proposals move to Snapshot.
3. $KRAUSE holders vote on Snapshot via token-weighted voting.
4. If passing, multisig points ENS field to a git commit hash or IPFS link.

### Proposal Requirements / "Proposal Checklist"
1. Proposal updating the org must provide an IPFS link or git commit hash to the proposed DAO state.
2. Proposals must provide clear action steps to Multisig if action is needed.
3. Proposals cannot force another person to take any action unless they've opted in (ex: Can force multisig signers to take action, or a social media manager to post/remove some content.)
