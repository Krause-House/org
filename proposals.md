# Proposals
### Proposal Process
- Any NFT holder can submit a proposal to Stewards Team.
- Stewards Team decides what proposals move to Snapshot.
- $KRAUSE holders vote on Snapshot via token-weighted voting.

### Proposal Requirements
- Proposals must provide clear action steps to Multisig if action is needed.
- Proposals cannot force another person to take any action unless they've opted in (ex: Can force multisig signers to take action, or a social media manager to post/remove some content.)
