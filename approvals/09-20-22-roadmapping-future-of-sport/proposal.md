### Overview

Building on the updated [Krause House Game Plan](https://snapshot.org/#/krausehouse.eth/proposal/0x97f85099d9e0727fe49f31638e9e42d4148478ace5f88aab5147efc29494fd11), this project proposes a collaboration to establish a shared vision of the future of sport, and a roadmap for getting there.

It will result in one or more visual (with text) outputs that summarize a shared understanding of:

- sport and the ecosystem around it,
- how it is changing,
- how we’d like it to be, and
- where effort is best invested to bring those changes about.

For Krause House, this will be valuable in the following ways:

- help Jerrys evaluate and direct resources toward high-value activities
- help Krause House Capital develop community aligned investment strategies
- build awareness and demonstrate leadership for Krause House across the broader sports ecosystem.

As a token swap with [SuperBenefit](https://superbenefit.org), this project will:

- Signal community alignment with SuperBenefit and open doors for future collaboration.
- Provide Krause House governance influence over SuperBenefit's direction and research and initiatives into creating better futures through decentralization.
- Resource the development of a vision and roadmap for the future of sport as imagined by Jerry's and the Krause House ecosystem.

### Proposal Specification

15,000 $KRAUSE is being requested, to be allocated as follows:

- Internal: 5,000 $KRAUSE to the Purpose and Values team for overseeing the project and recognizing participants.
- Token Swap: 10,000 $KRAUSE to SuperBenefit (0x731c837121C15e1e7e3cfc0E2588f4d0B35FdD48), in exchange for 20,000 $SPRB, the SuperBenefit governance token to be received at (0xE4762eAcEbDb7585D32079fdcbA5Bb94eb5d76F2).
- SuperBenefit will further incentivize project participation in the SuperBenefit community as needed with an additional 10,000 $SPRB.

After completion the community will have the option to make an additional swap based on results of this project and/or to encourage further collaboration. The following options will be presented:

- No additional swap
- 10,000 $KRAUSE for 20,000 $SPRB

- [$SPRB](https://etherscan.io/token/0xfC3Ac26D9A4A00B2534298c933A84F54430B3850#balances), SuperBenefit’s governance token has a fixed supply of 10,000,000 (with [2,000,000 bridged to Polygon](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xDaC5f23D2890A1129a3Fc6416b292A0ca82D3ccc#balances)), and has no value.
- A ratio of  1:2 ($KRAUSE : $SPRB) was used to determine swap ratio using the principle of each DAO having equal governance influence over the other as a result of this token swap.

### How will funds be managed?

The Purpose and Values team will oversee this project and the project allocation of 5,000 $KRAUSE. 

The SuperBenefit team will report in to the Purpose and Values team and oversee their own team and internal allocation of 10,000 $SPRB.

Token swaps (10,000 $KRAUSE to SuperBenefit, 20,000 $SPRB to Krause House) will be sent to each community’s treasury upon commencement of this project and will be managed as each receiving community decides.

### Project Details

The sports industry and experience is undergoing a major transformation, and Krause House is at the epicentre. While our mission is clearly focused on buying and managing an NBA team, our broader influence and opportunity is becoming apparent.

Visualizing and navigating systemic transformations is both opportunity rich and challenging. This is where [SuperBenefit](http://superbenefit.org/) comes in.

**About SuperBenefit**

[SuperBenefit's mission](http://superbenefit.mirror.xyz/) is to develop the social and financial flywheels that enable invention and acceleration of a better world. This includes strengthening capacities for systems innovation and supporting people to clarify pathways towards shared goals.

**Proposed Process**

Working together with Krause House, SuperBenefit proposes to lead a process through the following phases over 5-8 weeks.

1. **Framing:** working with core, stewards, team leads, and select advisors to introduce the intended approach, its purpose, and its potential future uses.
2. **Visioning**: working sessions and open invitations to imagine desirable and possible futures for professional sport. Synthesis to shape a compelling vision and directional goals. Includes a working session and two iterations.
3. **Mapping transition challenges and pathways:** surfacing the systemic fields of action needed to create transitions from current to future states. Includes a working session, two iterations, incorporating the vision and publishing as a high-level ‘Transformation Map’.
4. **Crowdsourcing activity across ‘map’:** crowdsourcing actions and innovations being undertaken around the world that have alignment with the intention and orientation of the map.

**Review**

SuperBenefit and Krause House’s ‘Purpose and Values’ team to review the process, its effect, and determine options for further activities.
