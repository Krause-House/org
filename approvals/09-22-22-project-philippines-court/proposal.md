### ELI5 (Explain it Like I’m 5) Project Value-Add

Requesting 12K USDC to fund painting and refurbishment of a court in the Philippines for a TBA NBA Team pitch

We want to design this court specifically themed around an TBD NBA team that we are in contact with and have received approval from their front office to proceed. Based on our conversations with teams, visibility into top international markets it a top priority for them. This would be an effort to expand visibility into one of basketball's biggest market.

### Project Details

After NFT NYC we met with Mike Swift who runs a project called  “Every Court Can Dream” that is on a mission to restore 1000 basketball courts. He has already done 125. Ahead of our pitches towards NBA teams, we want to show that Krause House can have impact in countries around the world by partnering with Mike Swift to build a court in the Philippines. 

We want to design this court specifically themed around an TBD NBA team that we are in contact with and have received approval from their front office to proceed. Based on our conversations with teams, visibility into top international markets it a top priority for them. This would be an effort to expand visibility into one of basketball's biggest market.

We have a narrow window of time so that we are able to show our efforts during NBA pitches that will start Oct. 10th  

We are in contact with a few boots on the ground to connect us with local basketball organizations, orphanages, players, etc to help coordinate and put this on

The high-level framework: 

- Partner with Mike Swift to build court
- Host a youth camp + cash-prize tournament
- Capture content and edit a 5-minute documentary + small clips

We want to accomplish all of this from 10/3-10/11

On top of refurbishing the court, we want to donate merchandising such as either socks, shirts, basketball or shoes to these youth kids 

We’ll need up to two KH representatives on the ground to oversee the project so that we are capturing the necessary moments & things are moving forward. The rest of the team we plan to our curated list of locals native to the Philippines. 

The logistics have been planned around on the limitations in Philippines during October and ready
