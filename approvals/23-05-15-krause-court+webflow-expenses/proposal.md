### What is being requested?

- **USDT reimbursement based on voter selection of the choices listed below.**

### Why are funds needed?

Since July 2022 I have incurred expenses overseeing the management of Krause Court created for NFT NYC and the Krause House website that was rebranded found here → [www.krausehouse.club](http://www.krausehouse.club)

Below is the breakdown all the expenses incurred since July.

### Why Now?

I’ve been trading my time and been using any contributor compensation towards managing these on-going expenses and can not further sustain spending more personal funds towards up-keeping assets for the DAO.

In April before transferring over the website I put up a utopia request for the Webflow hosting expenses but they have yet to be processed.

### Why is this important?

- These reimbursements will allow me to fulfill the remaining orders for folks that purchased a Krause Court NFT and also allow me to pay for any gas needed to send out Krause Court NFT giveaways without further having to pay out of my own wallet.
- Continuing to pay for the shipping container will buy me & Krause House time to figure out what do with the remaining court tiles whether we donate them, continue to sell them as NFTs or use to activate for another event further down the road.

Based on the context above i’m willing to let the community vote on the following choices of upfront reimbursements:

- Full Reimbursement - Transport + storage expenses: **$9267.47.**
- Full Reimbursement + Cost of Shipping Tiles: **$11269.16.**

A vote no or abstain all together will require me having to dispose the Krause Court completely, donate or transfer ownership to someone else within the community. 

### How will I know this is executed properly?

dbag#3251 will submit receipts of storage unit to the Stewards Team and will be added to the [KH Transactions Log](https://www.notion.so/e44eec07c098494ea9a8468395af50f9).

dbag#3251 will also provide any shipment tracking numbers for any tiles delivered to customer to prove reimbursement went towards delivering the court tiles. 

### What happens if someone runs away with this budget?

It is on voters to ensure the recipient can be trusted with the amount requested.  Currently, we do not require any deposit or other formal means of risk mitigation.

Stewards will hold the right to end the monthly reimbursement at their discretion
