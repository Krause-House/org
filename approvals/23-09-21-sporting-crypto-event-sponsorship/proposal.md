**Concluding notes**

We believe that fans need a bigger say in sports. In the eyes of Sporting Crypto, Krause House is at the absolute bleeding edge when it comes to developing a thesis and putting it into practice to democratise sports ownership. 

We want Krause House to be put in front of some of the highest-ranking decision-makers in Sports, Web3, Tech, Media and Entertainment at our world-class events.

We view this as a perfect marriage and would love to have Krause House as a sponsor at our next NYC event.
