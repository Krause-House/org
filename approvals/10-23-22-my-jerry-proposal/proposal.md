Here’s a look into some of the other projected Rewards from MyJerry [https://myjerry.gitbook.io/myjerry/season-1-rewards](https://myjerry.gitbook.io/myjerry/season-1-rewards)

# Responsibility Clause

If any emergent work for NBA teams arises, the team will be available as needed related to NBA ownership acquisitions.

If an opportunity presents itself, members of the MyJerry team may need to reallocate 10-90% of their time and would be impossible to predict currently. 

MyJerry funded team members will prioritize work necessary to purchase a share in an NBA team. While funded members will attempt to continue MyJerry exploration, time allocation will lean towards an NBA opportunity. Funded members will continue on a stream unless otherwise proposed by the community.

# **What is MyJerry?**

MyJerry is a social, gamified app for basketball fanatics where digital and IRL engagement is rewarded. It’s more than an Avatar project. Users compete to level up and earn rewards by shooting hoops, socializing in online basketball communities, and completing basketball-related challenges.

Tradeable wearables, badges, and digital rewards can be earned through MyJerry, equipped on your PFP avatar and proudly displayed in your profile. Physical rewards like tickets to NBA games, NBA merch, and autographed goods can also be earned by levelling up.

MyJerry brings together basketball players, fans, and future NBA owners from around the world to compete, earn, and have fun with the sport we all love!

We’d love for you to sign up to create your custom Avatar for free and start playing [https://app.myjerry.club/](https://app.myjerry.club/)

Disclaimer: As this is a beta test, we’d love for you to share feedback through the in-app form to make this the best possible experience for basketball fans around the world!

### Who is it built for?

We’ve built a product for sports organizations to engage fans with.

### **Target User**

MyJerry’s target audience is NBA Enthusiasts who:

- Watch basketball highlights
- Are knowledgeable about players on teams, team performance & can have playful NBA banter
- Engage with social media content, podcasts, youtube
- Probably own some merch & are willing to buy cool swag
- Want to interact with and/or get closer with their favorite players/teams

### **Business Model**

As outlined in the [Krause House’s Game Plan](https://krausehouse.mirror.xyz/IZm6c5XN58msf_f-UVPmOWLTJfSUwSuB80j8mYjfBZA), we are still in the Credibility Phase and what we’ve realized since building MyJerry is that the system we’ve created is a way to not only track and reward KH community members + onboard hundreds of thousands of basketball fans… but also how it can be used as infrastructure for other sports, brands, communities and organizations.

1. In short-term, onboarding NBA enthusiasts for free on the MyJerry app
    1. We will focus on building up Market Share as the “basketball rewards app.” 
    2. We’d like to onboard basketballs fan to the app & KH Ecosystem + Community
    3. In this time, our focus will be on studying user behaviors & stickiness of the product
    4. For Public Beta (~Dec 10), we will introduce the Freemium model for users to choose from 1) A Free Generic Avatar with 1x XP Multiplier or 2) A Premium Customizable Avatar with 1.5x XP Multiplier
    5. We will explore Battle Pass & Digital Wearable monetization as we launch Public Beta
2. White label MyJerry for sports teams & brands who are looking to incentivize their fanbase and reward them

- Onboard thousands of basketball & sports enthusiasts to Krause House, continuing to shape the narrative and pitch of Krause House DAO to the NBA. We see it as a really powerful trojan horse to get many more basketball fans & players involved, think STEPN for basketball [https://stepn.com/](https://stepn.com/)
- Visible product developed, in-house, by Jerry’s in Krause House; a product we can rally behind and proliferate while building credibility and reputation in the sports industry

From KH Beta Launch Date Sept 29 2022

### **Current Partnership Opportunities**

MyJerry is more than a “PFP” project. It’s a rewards system that can be used to onboard hundreds of thousands basketball fans into the Krause House ecosystem (regardless of bull or bear market) and as a secondary goal, it can be white labeled for other organizations.

**White Label Prospects**

- In the past two weeks we’ve had several inbound organizations reach out to explore using MyJerry for their needs
- **NBN23 / SWISH’s Web3 department**
    - SWISH is an app that tracks basketball live stats, results, rankings for organized basketball leagues around the world
    - SWISH’s Web3 team is negotiating with the MyJerry to implement the MyJerry Avatars & XP system into it’s app of 300,000 existing users
    - KH Benefit: We are currently in discussions for the project as the primary vendor and are negotiating a fee & NFT royal
