### Proposal

The Stewardship Team is currently a team of eight:

- Commodore
- Flex Chapman
- Mario Lopes
- Magnus
- Eli
- Lewwwk
- Dogstoevsky
- Glad Robot

Shanny has been in KH since March of 2022 & was part of the core team on the [NFT.NYC](http://NFT.NYC) event. She has been highly active in making introductions across the ecosystem, leads the All In for Sport initiative, and brings experience in design and athletic training to the Steward’s team. Shanny believes in our core mission & exemplifies our community values. 

The new Stewardship Team roster would remain at 8 with the swapping of Shanny with Dogstoevsky. 

Proposed New Stewardship Team roster:

- Shanny
- Commodore
- Flex Chapman
- Mario Lopes
- Magnus
- Eli
- Lewwwk
- Glad Robot
