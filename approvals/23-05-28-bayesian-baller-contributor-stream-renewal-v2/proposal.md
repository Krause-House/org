**TL;DR - Contributor Value-Add**

A member of the community since Day 1, Bayesian Baller has been contributing to Krause House on a variety of fronts -- notably in media, podcasting, and analytics roles -- now for over one year.

Bayesian leads all of Krause House’s basketball analytics and data science initiatives, which include collaborations with the BIG3, Overtime Elite, as well as, prospective NBA partners. He is also the Host & Executive Producer of Around The Association, Krause House’s go-to podcast for all things basketball, which now has a show catalog fast approaching 35 episodes.

Furthermore, Bayesian has some exciting new projects on the horizon for Summer ‘23 that will aim to provide exclusive membership benefits for NFT holders and hope to create a world class experience for community members while driving revenue for the DAO.

This contributor stream renewal will allow Bayesian to continue creating original content for the community, providing technical value for Krause House’s teams and prospective clients, as well as, pushing the envelope and pioneering innovative new community building experiences.

### **What will Bayesian Baller ship during Summer ‘23?**

**1)** **BIG3 x OTE: Basketball Strategy & Data Analytics Collaborations**

The 2023 BIG3 campaign is fast approaching and the Ball Hogs will be taking their show on the road to some of the biggest cities in the United States from June through August!

Similar to last summer, Bayesian is looking forward to leading all of the data analytics and basketball strategy initiatives for the team. He will collaborate directly with Head Coach Rick Barry and the players, and use advanced stats / video analysis techniques to craft custom scouting reports for the team to use during games and practices.

Here are some of the scouting reports and analytics projects Bayesian created for the Ball Hogs last summer:

- [**Week 6 • BIG3 Scouting Report vs. 3's Company**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-u9UkBi6Ff8Jv5MUnPZMSI6FnCNftpwG/view?usp=share_link)
- [**Week 5 • BIG3 Scouting Report vs. Aliens**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GVBbOwzUZbk0fWGhnIJ5LuQ95x5vcNaZ/view?usp=share_link)
- [**Week 4 • BIG3 Scouting Report vs. Tri-State**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KT7K4z_Ld5_fNN7wiFHdKGj9jRRuCHX4/view?usp=share_link)
- [**Week 3 • BIG3 Scouting Report vs. Triplets**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rqnl7j9ybWFre9cpsK2nxl7uVRa6ohVU/view?usp=share_link)
- [**Week 2 • BIG3 Scouting Report vs. Ghost Ballers**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FrvImaWGpwA7-Vwc22pMfYryWBa3doMq/view?usp=share_link)
- [**Week 1 • BIG3 Scouting Report vs. Killer 3's**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10r3Fh3zGn6BwM2gn9c4SK7Q_HyxCoPac/view?usp=share_link)

Some of these data-driven scouting reports - which featured unique research around shot quality, lineup analysis, and in-game strategy - were also publicly promoted by the BIG3 on Twitter to their more than 140k followers while others were circulated within the Krause House community as exclusive content for token-holders. Creating data-driven content specifically for social media will be one of the focal points of Bayesian’s efforts in Summer ‘23.

Additionally, during Spring ‘23 Bayesian began exploring Overtime Elite data and producing analytics content on behalf of our partner team, the YNG Dreamerz. This original content caught the attention of the OTE leadership team -- including their Director of Social Media, Director of Editorial Operations, Community Manager, and Social Media Manager.

After meeting with these key stakeholders, they expressed interest in having Bayesian produce original content like this specifically for OTE’s Social Media accounts. Some ideas included videos where Bayesian whiteboards his analytics projects and films them with voice overs articulating each of his data-driven discoveries. Other ideas include producing content about not only the YNG Dreamerz but also some of the league’s other notable teams (e.g. Cold Hearts, City Reapers) and their high-profile, future NBA talent. The sky's the limit for this partnership and we’ve only begun to scratch the surface of what is possible!

Here are samples of the analytics work that Bayesian produced and presented to the OTE leadership team:

**2) Around The Association: Content Creation & Podcasting Strategy**

Since January ‘22, Bayesian has been the Host & Executive Producer of [**Around The Association**](https://open.spotify.com/show/3YadlLpwrMTOG0ecvX65bw), the official basketball podcast of Krause House DAO & the first podcast launched by a non-steward under the community's burgeoning media network.

From day one Bayesian’s intent in launching Around The Association has been to drive community engagement, demonstrate Krause House's basketball acumen to the world, as well as, to break down the barrier to entry into Web3 and get everyday hoops fans interested in DAOs.

The Around The Association content catalog currently stands at 33 episodes deep and includes interviews with an impressive list of guests - including current and former NBA players, coaches, front office members, national media, and successful sports-tech entrepreneurs. All of whom Bayesian has educated on the mission of Krause House.

Here’s a list of the episodes Bayesian has published so far in 2023:

- [**S2, E13 • The Legend of Jimmy Buckets, The Finally Healthy Nuggets, The Suns Won’t Quit the Midrange, Plus LeBron & Steph Refuse to Age**](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ABMvnxlY3weHT6btipSxQ?si=xK-6y_uuQ52hyiVnmsp1uQ)
- [**S2, E12 • NBA Playoff Preview & Awards Season w/ Rob Basha & Trey Pettus**](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7iZLjM57KHEHfCo6EZEvym?si=cB3VfB2MQvum6nTGLFFexA)
- [**S2, E11 • Houston, We Have A Problem…**](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4LiqzlukS8aYnx1aVSjXBT?si=oQF7EIg-SDyYlPd_tqe2vQ)
- [**S2, E10 • And Then There Were Sixteen…**](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7rHw2d5eZvr5vgfTYocqYq?si=kC1Oc8DfTk6K26rRFq4lEA)
- [**S2, E9 • This Is March! A Tradition Unlike Any Other**](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5t1IVA7iVOTBC5W8KXbIJW?si=ljoPK49rSHO9GuuBSCgrNQ)
- [**S2, E8 • Building A Basketball Empire w/ Alan Arlt, Founder of Ultimate Hoops**](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0HlKHmajZKDRRVWS1tUNMq?si=Tpp9yTDNRyCvikYMmsWZ4w)
- [**S2, E7 • KD to Phoenix, Kyrie to Dallas, & Russ to Utah? NBA Trade Deadline Special w/ Rob Basha**](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7pPfiQldfwoT2yekhGsYRL?si=U2k6MouvQ_W5fVRgorUCxg)
- [**S2, E6 • Pac-12 After Dark, Gonzaga’s Foreign Affairs, & Houston’s Diaper Dandy w/ Crabtree**](https://open.spotify.com/episode/13I2G5a9fywj2cji4s4s0b?si=S7FZJA8mRpSIznMlptShPA)
- [**S2, E5 • Golden State’s Ja-Dropping Christmas, Paolo Banchero’s Historic Rookie Season, & The Playoff Bound New York Knicks**](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1OtOZwLIYIOMmXrQpl6dKU?si=OVOHZsiiQGmjdBJyfwiIGw)

Furthermore, something that Bayesian and Crabtree experimented with during Winter and early-Spring ‘23 was creating and posting Krause House-branded Around The Association podcast clips to TikTok and YouTube. During this experiment, the content garnered an impressive amount of engagement:

- **[TikTok:** 67.1k views, 4.8k likes](https://www.tiktok.com/@watchgameday)
- **[YouTube:** 25.3k views, 681 likes](https://www.youtube.com/@watchgameday/shorts)

One of the most challenging parts of doing this at scale though was manually assembling the clips and highlight reels that get paired with the podcast audio and transcription. However! With the cutting-edge LLM technology that Peterrr is building, he and Bayesian have been discussing using his models to automate Around The Association clips for mass production and scalability across TikTok and YouTube starting as soon as Summer ‘23. This would be a massive win and allow us to push content at scale on a consistent basis. All -- of course -- with Krause House branding front and center!

**3) Krause House Hoops: Pop-Up Pickup x League Exploration**

Back in February, **[Alan Arlt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alanarlt/)** was a guest on Around The Association. Alan is the Founder of Ultimate Hoops, the revolutionary basketball league that NBA-ified recreation hoops and was ultimately acquired in a lucrative deal by Lifetime Fitness.

Alan and Bayesian quickly became close and have been meeting bi-weekly for the past 3 months on a vision to revolutionize the traditional rec basketball league model. Alan is adamant that the next wave of rec leagues will not be led by athletics or fitness companies, but rather by tech companies and Web 3.0 communities looking to create world class experiences for their members while driving revenue to their communities.

In turn, Bayesian and Alan have begun collaborating with Flex, Mario, and Crabtree to gain feedback and move towards making this dream become a reality for Krause House. There are two primary models being explored:

- **League Approach (End Goal):** Krause House branded adult basketball league in a major U.S. city with a large contingency of existing Jerry’s. We would strike a partnership deal with a host venue in that city and launch a 6-8 team league. Similar to Ultimate Hoops, the league would focus on creating an NBA-caliber experience for its players and be fully equipped with unique features like stats, photos, and video content all hosted on an exclusive league website. To enter the league, each player/team would be required to purchase a Krause House NFT and/or pay an annual membership fee that would go to our community. In addition to access to the league, the NFT/membership fee could grant players access to an assortment of VIP perks and benefits. Think Soho House, but for recreational basketball.

- **Pickup Approach (Interim Goal):** Krause House branded exclusive, pop-up pickup runs this summer in a city that the Ball Hogs will be touring. To play in the pickup runs, each player would be required to hold a Krause House NFT and/or pay a cost of entry fee for the weekend. In addition to access to the pickup run, the NFT/cost of entry fee could grant players access to the Ball Hogs game, meet-and-greets with the BIG3 players, on top of other community events. Think of NFT NYC meets Tech Runs.

The goal here would be to drive revenue for Krause House while providing tangible benefits for community members. There may be a larger, more specific proposal for this project forthcoming at a later date to compensate Alan and cover any necessary league startup fees. More to come!
