## **REASON FOR PROPOSAL**

Quai54 is the biggest basketball tournament with a lot of exposure (media brands, the worldwide basketball community, and NBA players). 

In addition to the basketball journey, the decentralized process to choose the participants of the ITL/KH/Princeton team is representative of the DAO process and what decentralized governance in sports can bring in terms of community building, fan governance, and participation. 

With the focus during the tournament for Krause House to approach the basketball community deeper, it’s also a powerful tool to communicate for many months and show how a decentralized process works (tryouts, streaming, draft process…). 

Last but not least, the tournament in 2024 will be very close to the Olympics games and will bring a lot of attention. Jordan Brand plans to increase even more investment in this event.
