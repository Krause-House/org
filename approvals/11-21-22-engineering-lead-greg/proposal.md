# Summary

I am requesting a stream of 10,000 USDC / month + 5,000 KRAUSE / month to “**design and develop the infrastructure and applications for the future of fan engagement**.” My working approach will leverage 2-week sprints with highly defined goals and communicated results. I’m using this approach so that we have engineering bandwidth dedicated to the project while also using a well-known efficient process to rapidly iterate through prototypes. 

This role will provide Krause House with the actualization of the “show > tell” strategy Flex has developed.

**My first two-week sprint (and potentially more afterward) will focus on the Content Lab being proposed separately.**

If at the end of the 3-month period, greg has not produced an ongoing project the DAO is in support of continuing, he will forfeit 50% of his total KRAUSE.

## Primary Goals

- Rapidly develop public-facing products that improve our credibility as leaders in the fan engagement and sports management spaces
- Leverage partnerships formed by Mario and Flex to demonstrate our ability to provide value to teams and players
- Ensure there is a full-time high-context engineer providing a technically-minded perspective to complement the work of Flex, Mario, and Commodore
- Set in place systems and direction for Krause House’s future as it relates to engineering and design

## The Role

In the short term, his role is intended as highly focused on designing/building/engineering time and *not* management/leading of a dev team. My objective while the building will be to take the wide array of insights and knowledge we’ve gained as a collective and distill it into use cases that are both innovative and useful.

What this role will include if this proposal is passed:

- Developing web3 systems and protocols for fan involvement in professional sports teams, especially basketball.
- Building products and systems that pave the way for Krause House to be a leader in the future of sports.
- Outlining systems for the future of Krause’s engineering endeavors
- Purchasing an NBA team with all the other Jerry’s.

What this role will not include if this proposal is passed:

- Developing internal DAO tooling
- Recruiting and onboarding
- Managing a team

I’ve put a lot of thought into where my strengths and weaknesses lie within the context of Krause House and our goal to own and operate an NBA team. I have also spoken with several Stewards and other high-context individuals within the DAO, and I believe the perspective reflected in this proposal to be an objective evaluation of how I can best impact Krause House.

# Proposal

- A monthly budget of $10,000 USDC + 5,000 $KRAUSE
- Paid monthly
- 3 months starting (in arrears) November 14th
- The stream can be canceled at any point by the DAO through a proposal, at which point future payments will cease (prorated to the day canceled).

# Context

After considering my role within Krause House and how I can be an agent for progress toward our goal, I found my first full-time proposal deeply resonated with how I prefer to work. This proposal closely mirrors the original proposal and will focus on rapid iteration to answer the question “What does the future of fandom look like?”

This is a movement *away* from the direction of my previous proposal which was (in my opinion) a failed attempt to form a team around my original role. A helpful framework I’ve found to think about this is “large team = ambiguity bad, single individual = ambiguity good”. As an individual in a highly autonomous role, I can navigate ambiguity and build things to produce clarity from it. This wasn’t nearly as easy in a team-based role and is the reason for reverting to an individualized stream.

# More Detail

## Working Structure: 2-week Sprints

This role will be reliant on 2-week sprints to define goals and deliver results. The first week of each sprint will culminate in a clickable prototype demoed on the Thursday town hall. Feedback and insights will then be published on Friday. The second week of each sprint will lead to a released deliverable. This could be a feature added to an existing Krause House product or initiative or a new, standalone deliverable.

The structure of the sprints on a day-to-day level is subject to change but will mirror the following:

### Week 1:

- Identify problem space
- Select opportunities within the identified space
- Decide on a single opportunity
- Build a prototype with no underlying data

### Week 2:

- (If promising prototype feedback) build MVP of the feature or product
- (If not promising feedback) revert to week 1

This approach will maximize our findings through real experimentation while establishing Krause’s credibility to deliver on many of the ideas we pitch.

## Why This Role Matters

As a DAO, we are operating in unknown territory with limited clarity between us and our goal. Our objective has never been done before and by many is even considered impossible. The difficult macro environment our industry is currently navigating makes the route to our objective even more clouded.

Given these obstacles, Krause House needs to adopt a strong mentality of “show > tell”. Flex has developed this framework when interacting with owners and has discussed it at length. This role aims to actualize that framework not only for owners and the future of fan-based ownership but the sports industry in general.

By adopting a lean, two-week iteration mentality, I’ll be able to quickly uncover both opportunities and obstacles in implementing a large number of ideas. Additionally, this will provide both evidence and clarity for Krause House’s approach and value proposition.

This role serves a secondary function of ensuring there is a high-context engineer on the team full-time. This adds a technically-minded perspective to complement the work of Flex, Mario, and Commodore.

## Initial Project

Out of the gate, I will be using this working structure to work with Crabtree on the Content Lab project being introduced in a separate proposal. I’d like to also find time to work on projects that leverage our recent partnerships with OTE and In The Lab.
