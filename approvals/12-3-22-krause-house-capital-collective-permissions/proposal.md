**PROPOSED PERMISSION UPDATE**

Brand Usage: Krause House Capital Collective

Smart Contract: Krause House Captial Collective ERC-721M, minted through [Syndicate.io](http://Syndicate.io)â€™s [Collectives](https://guide.syndicate.io/en/products/collectives/getting-started) product. 

**REASON**

Krause House attracts ownership and investment opportunities across sports and web3. On the ownership side many of those opportunities are beyond the NBA, and on the investment side, many are beyond those that will help us buy an NBA team.

Creating a Krause House Capital Collective, gated by an NFT, allow us to share those opportunities with a broader audience while at the same time attract those outside of Krause House who may later want take the next step to becoming a Jerry. It also builds a receptive audience for new investment opportunities incubated within Krause House. 

The first test of this will be through the creation of a Krause House Capital Collective telegram group(s) token gated through Krause House Capital Collective NFT. Within the telegram we may facilitate community calls around projects of interest to the community and where mutual interest exists make it easier for project proponents and community members to continue conversations directly. Further evolution of the collective will be informed by the community. 

Setup and this initial test will be facilitated by Lewwwk#4227 and peterrr#4718 and is a practical continuation of Decentralized Investment Operations and Capital Coordination workstreams.
