### Proposal

Allocate $KRAUSE from the existing Gitcoin DEI Grant Program Sponsorship and Participation budget to All In For Sport.

### What is All In For Sport

All In For Sport (AIFS) is an experiment to create a perpetual funding mechanism to support projects around the world that support inclusion and empowerment through sport. The approach is to collaborate with athletes in development of the traits and 1:1 creations of nouns-style NFTs. Sponsors are invited to contribute to a treasury that supports a reserve price for the auctions. Proceeds from the NFT auctions are available to be granted to projects as selected by the community.

### Value Propositions

For Krause House, this is a way to celebrate what sport brings to people and communities around the world, while demonstrating how decentralized technology and practices can enable community-led governance and increase transparency, trust, and creativity.

For athletes and sponsors, AIFS also provides an opportunity to proactively demonstrate their support for inclusion and empowerment while using sport as the means for achieving it.

Finally, for Jerrys, this is an opportunity for us to experiment with governance design, build non-commercial collaborations across the ecosystem, and integrate with other Krause House projects like Heat Check, Decentralized Media, and international engagements like the Casa Krause in Guatemala and the Philippines project.

### Proposal Context

AIFS was created as part of the [Gitcoin DEI Grant Program Sponsorship and Participation Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/krausehouse.eth/proposal/0x795d2b73b44ad50016a81e7657b138970fd2bf321cc75948628db57c66cd15ef). Itâ€™s has attracted participation from many Jerrys to date (Shanny, Lewwwk, Phelps, KimR, UncleJohn, Boosh, Samuel, TYMED, Mario, dbag, crabtree), people from outside Krause House, and early interest from individuals and groups with strong relationships with professional athletes. 

The Purpose & Values team has decided to allocate its coordination budget of 5,000 $KRAUSE from that proposal to AIFS to further recognize and encourage participation in the project by new and old Jerrys alike.

This proposal allows the community to decide how to allocate the remaining 15,000 $KRAUSE which was set aside for project(s) for further accelerate the project. 

- Allocate 15,000 $KRAUSE to AIFS
- Allocate 10,000 $KRAUSE to AIFS
- Allocate 5,000 $KRAUSE to AIFS
- Do not allocate any of the project support budget to AIFS

This will conclude the Gitcoin DEI Grant Program and Sponsorship Participation project and any $KRAUSE not allocated to AIFS will remain in the Krause House treasury.
