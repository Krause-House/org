Requesting a budget of $2500 to purchase 100 Krause House shorts and resell them on the KH website and also keep 10 available for giveaways for KH contests like our season long NBA Pick Em’.

These shorts debuted at 2022 NFT NYC and were warmly received with notable [dunkers](https://www.instagram.com/p/CjWSLVRrECn/?img_index=1) & influencers still wearing and posting their outfits on social media.

We would retail the shorts at $40 for the public and $20 for NFT holders.
