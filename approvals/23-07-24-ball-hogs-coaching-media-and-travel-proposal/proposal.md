### **TL;DR - Contributor Value-Add**

During the Ball Hogs’ Week 3 trip to Brooklyn, Bayesian and Crabtree served as Krause House’s representatives on-the-ground assisting the team in a variety of ways and capturing groundbreaking, behind-the-scenes footage.

Bayesian assisted the team at practice, joined the team in the locker room, sat with the team on the bench, and conducted a video podcast with HC Rick Barry. Crabtree managed a team of photographers and videographers, conducted interviews with HC Rick Barry, and assisted Uncle Jon at the Krause House-sponsored fan events.

We have received an overwhelmingly positive outpouring of feedback regarding our work in Brooklyn — particularly from Rick Barry and the players. Ball Hogs’ captain Leandro Barbosa even asked Rick if Bayesian can travel with the team to the remaining games!

Subsequently, we would like to request funding to represent Krause House in the same ways at several of the Ball Hogs’ upcoming games (as well as if/when the team makes the playoffs).
