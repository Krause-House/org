### Team

- Josh Phelps
- Brandon Reese
- Mario/KH/any interested parties with remote/direction to Brandon R. and Josh on content and stories as needed; can develop a plan/agenda beforehand by meeting with San Pedro basketball camp directors and Hoops Sagrado.
    - Examples:
        - ESPN short with production help from Bryan Weaver https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HL8Lx-M_bUU&t=12s
        - I Am Yupik from contacts of mine https://vimeo.com/273912854
    - Update germane to the proposal after chatting with Dluxe - outside of daily footage and content from Brandon, and mini stories regarding the camps, DC kids, Guatemalan kids and adults, and Bryan Weaver, there could be an opportunity for a follow up proposal for Brandon regarding a longer, doc style film for submission to film festivals. Perhaps funding for this could be a joint effort between KH, Hoops Sagrado, and Project Backboard - would need discussion. Potentials included below.

### Project Details

**TLDR:** Budget covers at least 5 tournament games for both men and women’s teams, 2 youth camps for 100s of kids, lodging the week in San Pedro La Laguna, broadcast of games on fb live with KH logo overlayed, and countless opportunities to capture Krause House’s continued support and positive affect on the community in Guatemala plus the youth from Washington, DC. Could potentially dovetail into media opportunities in Washington, DC during Big3 playoffs (Josh is in talks with Deb/Uncle John on this.)

[The 2nd Annual KH/HS tournament in Guatemala](https://twitter.com/JPh3lps/status/1556476468477448193?s=20&t=hLHOLidAZ84o4Y4yDJ0eyA) provides a chance to build on last year’s success via a focus not only on the event itself but the stories of the participants across borders. With professional content creator/basketball player [Brandon Reese](https://www.instagram.com/brandonreese24/?hl=en), founder of The Hoop Bus and collaborator with groups like Project Backboard, 5 Star Camps and KH affiliate \, we can supercharge the content gathering and stories told. These can cover the DC youth experiencing culture outside of their own city, Hoops Sagrado founder Bryan Weaver and his 20 year journey, bilingual content with the players both women and men for whom basketball culture is woven within their own indigenous cultures, the list goes on and on. Josh Phelps will help assist all of this production beforehand, liaising with Hoops Sagrado, Krause House, San Pedro officials, and Brandon to ensure an agenda for capturing rich, powerful branded content and preparation to take advantage of any serendipitous opportunities. Content reach could also be tested in LATAM via TikTok and Instagram with Brandon or Josh posting from KH socials while geolocated in LATAM.

Immediately following the trip, the DC youth will return and should be able to join Uncle John and the Pig Pen during Big3 playoffs. Bryan Weaver is connected to DC media as well, there could be some crossover opportunities perhaps re: Big3 team ownership supports local DC basketball nonprofit, etc.

There will be another large trove of photos and videos from the trip both officially from Brandon Reese and also Josh which KH can use as well.
