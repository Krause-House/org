The scope of work for this includes up to 3 days per week, or 12 days per month by Lewwwk focused on:

- Fund structuring and formation
- Transaction negotiation and closing
- Capital infrastructure development, including entities and protocols
- Engaging and managing capital partners, investors, advisors, and contributors

**Purpose of this Work**

Krause House formed around an ambitious mission to buy an NBA team. The purpose of this stream is to help bring our mission home by securing the terms and capital for ownership in the top 5 leagues and beyond.

**Current Status**

We are currently raising capital to secure ownership positions in the EFL and a top-5 league, while doing diligence and pursuing a portfolio of opportunities in North America and Europe. A primary capital partner has expressed interest in investing mid 8-figures with us. We are working to firm up that commitment, finalise structure, and make our first investment.

**Results from Previous Work**

Lewwwk, in collaboration with Commodore, Flex, Matt Lynch, and advisors:

- Developed and led a mid nine-figure multi-year bid for an interest in a Top-5 league team (in process)
- Developed JV strategy for major acquisitions, serving to drive potential future KH collaborations
- Led conversations and confirmed pathways with the NBA for Krause House ownership in the NBA
- Represented Krause House at Thinking Football conference in Porto, deepening football presence
- Continued building relationships with multiple large scale media, institutional, and family office investors
- Drafted protocol infrastructures to enable onchain loyalty and ownership
- Explored potential partnerships with various technical and L2 rollup service providers
- Updated KH Capital strategy to include potential investment in KH TD, protocols, and assets
- Handled ongoing Krause House Capital administration
- Supported Treasury Diversification strategy and efforts

**What Changed Over the Last Stream**

We have now credibly demonstrated access to exclusive, top-tier, off-market opportunities. While transactions in sports have unpredictable outcomes and pacing, we have also demonstrated the capacity to build a robust portfolio of opportunities based on solid analysis and our unique approach to building enterprise value through digital innovation and fan engagement.

While the macro environment is still challenging, there is a notable shift out of the depths of bearishness. This is evident in both the macro and the crypto markets. The end of the SBF trial; deeper adoption of crypto in institutional finance; advances in web3 tooling and infrastructure; and a thawing of the VC and retail markets are all welcome news after a challenging 18 months.

**What Does Success Look Like**

- Capitalization of Krause House Capital
- First investment complete
- Krause House capitalization
