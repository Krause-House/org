## Create Norm: All kTx Signers should also be Stewards

Author: Commodore

To ensure the highest context possible, all kTx Signers (multi-sig) should also be Stewards. Stewards have the highest context within the DAO given their role to validate proposals.

********************What is a kTx Signer?********************

A kTx Signer is a member of Krause House’s transaction team or alternatively stated a signer on the multi-sig. 

**Why make this change?**

During the USDC depeg, the kTx Team needed to move with urgency to mitigrate the treasury’s risk. This opened up a conversation of who should be on the kTx Team & what type of context they should have. There was consensus at a recent Stewards Meeting that the highest context members of the DAO are Stewards and therefore we should mandate that all kTx Signers are also Stewards.

It should be noted that at this time it is undetermined if Stewards should ****also**** be kTx Signers.

A norm is a principle that guides the direction of the systems we build. The intention behind using norms is to create rules that are flexible & generalized to maximize the pursuit of our mission.
