# 3. Core Team Check-in

1. Where are our plans for the DAO?
2. What’s our plan for DAO finances?
3. How can you help?

### Where are our plans for the DAO?

1. **Secure a Letter of Intent:** Securing a minority position in an NBA team is the next major step in our mission.  In addition, this helps plant the seeds for objective (2) and (3).  This requires cultivating relationships with NBA teams and aggressive networking by this team.
2. **Raise for KH Capital:** Work with KH Capital (Lewwwk & others) to close a $100m+ PE Fund that will backstop KH sub-DAO equity positions. Equity positions in sports clubs will exist within a fully KYC’d, NBA by-law, & SEC compliant entity as a sub-DAO. KH Capital provides us the ability to structure a legal entity that sports clubs can interact with legally & compliantly, while KH Capital delegates access + governance to Krause House where allowed. Additionally, this gives us negotiation leverage to verbally commit to large sums of capital without knowing KH members’ appetite due to KH Capital being able to backfill any remaining allocation. Note: Closing a LOI with a NBA team is a massive accelerant to getting this fund closed.  
3. **DAO Treasury Diversification:** Once we secure a LOI, we intend to diversify our balance of $KRAUSE & USDC / ETH.
4. **Community Engagement:** Our community is our unfair advantage, and one of our core focuses is to cultivate richer community spirit. The early days of KH thrived pre-token, and we aim to bring this entrepreneurial spirit back to the community.  Part of the intention of moving towards mechanisms like Coordinape is to allow Jerry’s to “get after it” in any way, without permission, in a maximally “do-ocratic” way.  On top of this, we will experiment with new methods and platforms to connect Jerry’s with KH & each other.  Ultimately, the Krause House journey means nothing without camaraderie, new friends, and memories. WAGBAT.

### What’s our plan for DAO finances?

At this moment, we have roughly $1.3MM our [Mainnet](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe4762eacebdb7585d32079fdcba5bb94eb5d76f2) and [Polygon](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x40eDBC75C543954CDD9c5ae7398342788F46A85B) treasuries. Our community, talent, DAO infrastructure, brand, and network is a non-reproducible, organic, confluence of factors that puts Krause House in a unique position to succeed with our vision. It would be a mistake to shift to a defensive posture. 

1. We expect to pass less project proposals in USDC, and favor a more entrepreneurial style of funding via mechanisms like (but not limited to) Coordinape gift circles.
2. We also hope to expand the full-time team if we have the opportunity to bring on member who materially advances our ability to close a LOI with an NBA team, and/or deliver treasury diversification. 
3. It also should be noted that part of Flex & Commodore's objectives is to execute a Treasury Diversification to increase USDC and/or ETH in the treasury.

### How can you help?

While we hope to nudge the DAO towards less project based funding, we intend to make contributing to the mission easier by allowing Jerry’s to earn **without submitting a proposal**.

# 4. More Detail

1. Objectives + Responsibilities
2. Retrospective

## a. Objectives / Responsibilities

### Commodore - “Closer”

When discussing with ownership groups, there comes a moment when the idea at a high-level resonates, but we need to get into how it all would actually work. That is where Commodore’s background & accomplishments set the credibility of the pitch on the details on what / how this could work. Our solution has to be serve the needs of KH but also fit within compliance of NBA by-laws & SEC regulations. Teams will sometimes have customizations (such as 50% women ownership) suggestions that need to be structured into our offer. Commodore excels at providing the details on how this will all work across the four important domains of finance, legal, regulatory, & web3. 

### Flex - “Top of Funnel”

A combination of charm, vibes, & intellect allows Flex to find his way into introductions + partnerships with entities to deliver our goal. His ability to connect on a human level, then inspire with the broad vision has gotten us into meetings & conversations that are incredibly difficult to network your way into. Flex drives camaraderie on a human level on our pitches while also able to inspire with creative solutions to their needs. Flex is also the design eye behind every slide of our well designed decks. The number of NBA pitches, partnerships, & venture capitalists relationships who are interested in treasury diversification opportunities Flex provides is unmatched. 

### Mario - “Level 99 Jerry”

From the day he entered the Discord, Mario has taken initiative to build and maintain systems that welcome Jerry’s and leverage their ability and energy towards our mission. While he works across all areas of the DAO, his primary role will be continuing to engage the community and harness the crowd. As a part of this, Mario will be responsible for scaling the [Heat Check](https://twitter.com/heatcheckapp) app, which accelerates our partnership conversations & gives us a potential revenue generating project that the DAO recently approved.
