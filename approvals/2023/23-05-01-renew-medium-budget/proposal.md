Media Team (Medium project) - Renewal Proposal

Overview: Krause House DAO has a vision to revolutionize the sports industry through the use of blockchain technology. As part of that vision, we have created a Medium publication to bring in and engage interested readers on the Krause House vision.

This proposal aims to renew the Medium budget for the Krause House DAO in order to continue growing our audience on Medium and reach new investors, contributors, and partners. The goal is to publish 1 weekly article on KH Medium (+1000 words) + Thread on Twitter. These articles will focus on educating our audience on the benefits of blockchain technology in sports, as well as providing updates on the progress of the Krause House project. By expanding our reach on Medium, we will be able to attract more individuals who share our vision and are interested in investing, contributing or becoming partners with us.
