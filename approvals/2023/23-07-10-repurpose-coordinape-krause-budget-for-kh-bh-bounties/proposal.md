### Requested Budget:

Transfer the remaining balance of $KRAUSE to Mario & Jon to manage

### How will funds be used?

To reward & tip members who contribute to Krause House & the Ball Hogs

Members who reach in the top rankings of Moonlit every week will earn a proportionate amount of $KRAUSE. The amount of $KRAUSE will NOT be fixed each week but rather, determined by a committee composed of Mario & Uncle Jon. Details about Moonlit can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/Digital-High-Fives-Our-Community-Recognition-Program-55b730b69ff14c1dacb3c6e88dcb606a?pvs=21).

An [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2d74e850ad7712390a137465ba273c8334c0e6b5) of the wallet (0x2D74E850ad7712390A137465Ba273c8334c0e6b5) shows there are 20,000 $KRAUSE tokens remaining from the originally proposed budget.

If our proposal were to pass, we expect the 20,000 $KRAUSE to last until at least September 2023 with the goal of distributing no more than 8,000 $KRAUSE per month throughout the community.

### How will be bounties be advertised & tracked?

Bounties will be advertised in KH Discord, KH Twitter, KH Instagram as well as Ball Hogs Twitter & Ball Hogs Instagram.

Bounties will also be advertised to partners & non-profits working with the Ball Hogs.

Bounties will be tracked in a google sheet & regularly updated.

### How will funds be managed?

On a multi-sig managed by Mario Jon & Uncle Jon (2/2 signatures required)
Eli, current holder of the 20k $KRAUSE to send to this multi-sig
