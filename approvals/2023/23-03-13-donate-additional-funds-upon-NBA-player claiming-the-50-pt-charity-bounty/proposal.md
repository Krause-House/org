### ELI5 (Explain it Like I’m 5) Project Value-Add

This proposal is a follow up to acidisantana’s “[Provide Funding for a 50pt NBA Game Bounty](https://snapshot.org/#/krausehouse.eth/proposal/0xea4e4151cb0e673b525829fd9e3011cd703cf3715c45803936e9fc36866ec748)”

For context to KH members, on Jan 23 2023, the  “[Provide Funding for a 50pt NBA Game Bounty](https://snapshot.org/#/krausehouse.eth/proposal/0xea4e4151cb0e673b525829fd9e3011cd703cf3715c45803936e9fc36866ec748)” proposal passed and KH funded $1000 worth of ETH to the charity bounty on [Juicebox](https://juicebox.money/v2/p/436)

Since then, KH has reached ~1.83 ETH (~$2,800) and some NBA players have scored 50+ pts in a game.

I am asking for KH to donate an additional USDC or USD equivalent so that we bring the total donations raised to to $7,100 TOTAL . The donation will be on COMPLETION of the charity deal by whichever NBA player claims the bounty first. Example. if we have $3k claimed tomorrow by an NBA player for their charity, KH will donate an additional $4.1k to TOTAL $7.1k

**Why would we do this?**
KH’s 50pt charity bounty project has started to receive high profile attention and support including:

- Jesse Pollak - Coinbase’s Head of Protocols
- Juicebox’s entire team
- Mainstream sports media outlets
- Some NBA players interested in claiming the bounty

Donating additional funds will showcase our commitment to the NBA players charity and also demonstrate the power of our global basketball community. For example, if given the option “KH donated $3k to xyz NBA player” vs “KH donated $7.1k to xyz NBA player,” the latter is a better demonstration of a 6000+ global basketball community and its power to do good.

Also this additional donation will have the potential to drive further viral donations from members of the web3 community to whichever NBA player claims the bounty. We can frame the announcement as:

"Our DAO will be providing another $_k to the foundation on top of what was originally raised. We want to express our appreciation of {PLAYER} helping us prove that web3 is a powerhouse for decentralized coordination. We encourage other members of the web3 ecosystem to also consider donating in appreciation. This can be done via {player donation URL}."

### Requested Budget:

KH to donate the remaining USD difference and bring the total raised to $7.1k USD for the players charity

### How will funds be used + Clause

The funds will be sent to the NBA player’s charity of choice upon claiming the initial 50pt NBA Game Charity Bounty from Juicebox.

### How will funds be managed?

Funds will be sent by KTx team to the NBA player’s charity of choice.
