Mochi Cohort #2 Budget

Author: Mario Lopes & qvqtqr#4474

### ELI5 (Explain it Like I’m 5) Project Value-Add

After the success of Mochi Season #1, we are looking to partner with Mochi for Cohort #2, kicking off mid June with a focus on NBA content and Ball Hogs content.

Content will be produced in English, Tagalog and Hindi.

The benefits of the Mochi program is that it: 

1) creates a “digital street team/army” for Krause House and incentives community members to create video content for the DAO + our sports teams 

2) it serves as a community building tool & allows sports fans to engage with web3 in a frictionless manner

### Requested Budget:

Wallet: mochiworld.eth

$5000 USDT for Rewarding ~8 Mochi community participants + bonus performance

When? $2500 USDT at journey start to cover team base costs (by June 15). 

Remaining $2500 will be used for bonus payments for performance. Any remainder can be used for additional journeys (Season #3).

BONUS

100,000 plays guaranteed. If 100,000 plays is not hit within this journey, Mochi will return the amount above cost.

$10 per 1k plays over 100k ($5k cap)

### How will funds be used?

To pay Mochi Season #2 participants for making 1 social post/day about the NBA & Ball Hogs.

Platforms being used: With focus on TikTok for Philippines/Nigeria participants, and Instagram for India. Community members from other regions will also be able to participate.

### How will funds be managed?

Through Mochi and qvqtqr#4474 who will be administering payments

Based on the previous Season’s learnings, Season #2 will focus on the following:

- Less Is More: We will be hosting tryouts for Season 2, to qualify the top content creators before allowing them to play & earn from Mochi.
- Quality Shots at the Basket: Focus on systemizing the content created by providing tools like Caption software, best practices for editing and hosting weekly “ideation” sessions for coming up with viral content that can be posted in English, Tagalog & Hindi
- Targeted Sponsorships + Post Boosts: We will pick the best posts and make them fly with short promotional campaigns and small ad spends on TikTok & IG
- Team Engagement: Incentivize teams to engage with content (like, comment & share)
- Sub-Community Leadership: KH leadership + Mochi have identified leaders from the Philippines and India teams that will help manage & foster each sub-community throughout Season 2
- Community Voting: At the end of the season, the community will vote on their favorite content from creators to win a bonus prize.
