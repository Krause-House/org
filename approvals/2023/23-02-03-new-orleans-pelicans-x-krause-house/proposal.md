**New Orleans Pelicans X Krause House Proposal**

Author: Soothsayer

Krause House is in hot pursuit of meeting(s) with NBA ownership groups.  My personal contact and I, cumulatively referred to as Soothsquad, are offering a warm introduction of Krause House to a key member of the New Orleans Pelicans ownership group - all in the hopes of landing Krause House  a follow up meeting with them directly, either by Zoom or in-person.

More explicitly, if Soothsquad delivers a meeting with at least one of the following individuals: Gayle Benson and/or Dennis Lauscha - a $25,000 payout to Soothsquad will be triggered upon the conclusion of said meeting - regardless of outcome.

My contact has also offered to participate alongside Krause House in that meeting, if, when, and where it may to take place for an additional fee of $3,500 - upon Krause House’s request, can be determined at a later date.

The timetable for delivering at least the scheduling of this meeting lasts until May 31, 2023. 

Upon an LOI being executed between the New Orleans Pelicans and Krause House at the 1% level or higher, an additional compensation of $25,000 will be issued to Soothsquad.

If a minority acquisition occurs between Krause House and the New Orleans Pelicans, facilitated by Soothsquad, a separate compensation package will most likely be requested. The additional compensation package will require Soothsquad submitting an additional proposal that is commensurate with reasonable standard rates for a "finders fee.”

All compensation payouts can be issued to ETH address:
