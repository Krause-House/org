H-O-G Project Budget 

Author: Mario Lopes

### ELI5 (Explain it Like I’m 5) Project Value-Add

Requesting 1 ETH to sponsor Content Creators so we can test out a fan content creation system, incentivized through staking and earning crypto.

1 ETH would sponsor roughly 12-20 content creators from Philippines and India to spread the good word about KH & the BIG3 Ball Hogs.

### Requested Budget:

1 ETH to 0xC4F8361c7d19DF414fa387F6227FC6Ecb6d8D1be

### How will funds be used?

To sponsor international content creators to create daily content about Krause House and the Ball Hogs

### Project Details

Requesting 1 ETH to sponsor international content creators for the KH Content Creator hub we are launching in partnership with [Mochi](https://mochi.game/), Mike Swift & [In The Lab](https://inthelab.tv/en-ca)

**How it works:**

Here’s a link to a [detailed deck](https://pitchdeck.hypermatic.com/slides/lftuwmkl32487). Password: gohogs

- Content creators will enter the "H-O-G", a new content creation contest powered by web3, by staking their ETH
- For the initial run, the majority of content creators are from Philippines & India, so to reduce onboarding friction, we will sponsor these international content creators by backing each of them with ETH
- The contest is powered [Mochi](http://mochi.game), a sticky coordination game, to create short, shareable clips out of a pool of content.
- We’ll be sharing KH, Ball Hogs & In The Lab exclusive content each week.

**The Rules of the Game**

- Participants will join teams of 2-4 players to clip and post one TikTok daily. By posting one TikTok daily, they can EARN $OP but… if they don’t post a daily TikTok, they get their ETH slashed. 50% of the slashed ETH will go back to the KH Treasury and the other 50% will go to Mochi for their services.

**What content creators can EARN by playing the game:**

- 12 [**$OP**](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/optimism) and 4 $MOCHI to players (~$25 per day/person)
- 1 [**$OP**](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/optimism) to the Krause House treasury (~$2.50 per day/person)
- **Weekly prizes**: 50 $OP to the highest performing posts (weekly)
- **Grand prize:** 500 $OP to the highest performing accounts (cumulative)

**Risks**

There is a chance that we get low quality posts throughout this project since the coordination game emphasizes more about “habits” > quality. Luckily, through our partnerships with Mike Swift and In The Lab we reduced these risks. Mike & In The Lab have graciously offered to provide their trained content creator teams for this project.
