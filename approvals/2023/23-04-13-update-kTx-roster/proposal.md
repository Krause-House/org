# Update kTx Team Roster

****************Author:****************  Eli, Commodore, Shanny

**********Proposed New Governance State:********** [https://github.com/Krause-House/org/commit/1835d9975a8f37ce23ba0e09a7b1147eb46a19d4](https://github.com/Krause-House/org/commit/1835d9975a8f37ce23ba0e09a7b1147eb46a19d4)

**Shanny’s Multi-Sig Wallet Address:** 0x97f752e1d5F64CA932c32dBfF82f4c92710beE54

**************Summary**************

- Remove Eli from the kTx Team.
- Add Shanny (member of the Stewardship Team) to the kTx Team.

For reference, the kTx Team is the team that is responsible for creating, validating, and executing transactions on our multi-sig treasuries. Multisig signing requires 4/6 signers.

********Why?********

Vetting transactions and being an active signer requires time and a level of due diligence I’m (Eli) unable to commit currently.  To ensure the same level of signer difficulty on the multisig treasuries, I’m nominating Shanny as my replacement.

**Commodore’s Appraisal of Shanny**

During the USDC depegging, we had to make emergency treasury diversification movements. At that time, we were fortunate that Magnus was available. In this particular scenario — Shanny was available to help execute transactions, had the necessary context, but was unable to assist with executing transactions due to not being a signer.*

*Note: This is less true given that Eli has requested removal from the kTx Team. 

Shanny has demonstrated value as a Steward and she would be an excellent signer on the multi-sig.
