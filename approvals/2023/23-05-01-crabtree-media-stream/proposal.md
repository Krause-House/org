**************Summary**************

For the past year, crabtree has contributed on a variety of fronts - including media, product, and community.

He is the creator of [Gameday](https://gameday.krausehouse.club/), a Krause House product for internal and external creators. He was the creator of the [Uncle Jon Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfDKaSW2vV4&list=PLlhzSeLttOpV1d8ipHWLm2kGPiEqtO9zw&index=2), a documentary on our first seasons of being team owners. This involved travel to six BIG 3 games and other locations.

He also was the in-house photographer for NFT.NYC, co-hosted NBA [watch parties](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1SlgH9zHBg&list=PLlhzSeLttOpVJZARg-BFX8dHeomgwqtWL),  created a variety of [social content](https://www.instagram.com/p/ClmU1vgDY8S/), and designed [the onboarding videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlhzSeLttOpUpFMSn34LS1Zi89nwHQX1o) to support the community.

This stream will allow us to continue creating original media approaches for the community and providing talking points of value in external conversations.

p.s. I want to emphasize the Ball Hogs storytelling is the majority of the monthly work in this proposal. 

# Project Description & Deliverables

**Season 2 of Ball Hogs / The Uncle Jon / Krause House Ownership Story**

Documenting Season 2 of our ownership model focusing on Uncle Jon’s second run as CEO. This would call for a wide range of content capture before and during the season, and finding some unique narratives on Krause House’s evolution over the years.

The goal is to have a more holistic view of the Ball Hogs x KH (with Uncle Jon as main character). Content deep-dives and short form clips with players, coaches, fans, other Jerrys and Uncle Jon will be provided to the broader KH community. Ultimately this will all funnel up to having another, this time longer, documentary on owning a sports team.

Would involve some travel to Alabama and BIG 3 cities. I would also manage freelance video resources for weeks that didn’t call for travel that align with Uncle Jon’s needs.

Outcome(s)

- Capturing real work and real impact by a Jerry of Jerrys
- Build on native storytelling ability

**Analytics-to-Content with Bayesian Baller**

Ongoing work with Bayesian Baller on a series of analytics-to-content projects to be used for greater KH community and external conversations. Example project would be Ball Hogs preview, projections, and in-season analysis.

Content would be specifically designed for TikTok, IG, and YouTube consumption.

****************Greater Media Support****************
This isn’t factored into more compensation, this is more offering up being an expert resource to capture more stories via video for active Jerrys in this “The Time Is Now” phase. Whether it be 3x3 tournaments or tools being built, we are underutilizing this area.
