### TL;DR

Bayesian and Crabtree are requesting reimbursement for Week 7 in Charlotte and funding for Week 8 in Detroit.

### Explain It Like I’m 5

When we made the [OG proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/krausehouse.eth/proposal/0xf02fc5a52c9a9798b51de353e94684c94fee0fd6ce804c81cf4b33b90b53b59b), there were 6 games left:

- Miami
- Boston
- Charlotte
- Detroit
- Washington DC (if qualified)
- London (if qualified)

Due to our schedules at the time, we thought we could only attend 3 games: Miami, Boston, DC

However our schedules opened up, and we opted to attend Charlotte for our 3rd game. As such, we see two ways of interpreting this:

**A) The Spirit of the Law:** Assume the spirit of the original proposal was to attend 3 games, which we did and now we would like to attend more.

**B) The Letter of the Law:** Assume the details of the original proposal were to attend Miami, Boston, and DC specifically. In which case, we would like to get reimbursed for Charlotte and head to Detroit this weekend.

While A was the intent, B is now the clearest way to think about it. As such, this proposal is to send us to Detroit this weekend and reimburse us for Charlotte last weekend.

### What’s the value?

For starters, Rick and the players have specifically said they would like us to be in attendance. Uncle Jon can vouch for this. The relationship that we have established with our team is truly unprecedented. We have consistently been told that no other BIG3 ownership group has formed this kind of relationship with their coach and players and that we’re genuinely making a difference in ways that no other team had thought was previously possible.

And truth be told, none of it would be possible without being there in-person. There is only so much that can be done from afar. The practices, the bus rides, the huddles, the bench access… that’s where the secret sauce lies. The access that we’ve been granted by Rick and the players is absolutely unparalleled and something that we should be using to our advantage for as long as we possibly can.

We have 1 more game that’s promised, but beyond that who knows! Rick and Leandro could retire after this season and who’s to say that the next regime would be open and willing to grant us the same kind of access.

So, in our admittedly biased opinions, the value lies in our ability to continue nurturing these relationships, providing positive on-court value for our team, and offering behind-the-scenes access for other members of our community.

Because, when you take a step back and look at what we’ve accomplished this season, the story is writing itself! I could be wrong, but I don’t think it’s a coincidence that the Ball Hogs are having their most successful season ever. And THAT is the story that brings us one step closer to making this crazy dream a reality!

### **Funding Request**

- Maximum amount of 2,500 USDC per trip with a maximum of 2 trips.
- Will provide an invoice of expenses following completion of each trip.
- Note this amount is for both Bayesian and Crabtree combined — not apiece.

### **What will the funds be used for?**

**To Fund:** 

**August 12-14 | BIG3 Week 8 in Detroit, MI**

- Flights To-From Detroit
- Hotel Room in Detroit
- Transportation To-From Events
- Meals Not Covered By Events

**To Reimburse For:** 

**August 4-6 | BIG3 Week 7 in Charlotte, NC**

- Flights To-From Charlotte
- Hotel Room in Charlotte
- Transportation To-From Events
- Meals Not Covered By Events

*Disclaimer: All flights will be standard economy/coach and we will be splitting the most basic hotel room available. We understand that this opportunity is a privilege, not a right and we will treat it as such with the utmost respect.*

### **What will Bayesian and Crabtree deliver?**

- Bayesian will be assisting HC Rick Barry and the Ball Hogs’ players at practice, on the bench, and in the locker room on game days, while continuing to lead all of the team’s scouting and analytics efforts.
- Crabtree will be leading all of the weekend’s photography, videography, interviews, and media efforts capturing footage that will be used on social media and in the Ball Hogs’ Season 2 Documentary.
