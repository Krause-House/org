## **TL;DR - Contributor Value-Add**

Mario’s proposal ended April 30 and is looking to renew beginning June 1. 

Mario’s renewal will have an emphasis on the following areas over the next 4 months:

- Community Management & Communications
    - Sharing announcements to community members across relevant platforms and continue being a support mechanism for all KH members
    - Updating our library of resources for new members in the KH Notion (emphasis will be on short video how-to’s)
    - Continuing managing the KH Discord Community, fielding questions sync & async in public & private channels
    - Building up the KH Telegram in preparation of its public launch that will invite new members
    - Continuing to run daily sports engagement activities like [NBA Pick Em](https://www.instagram.com/p/CrCAYniOcX4/) followed by BIG3 Pick Em
    - Growing the Ball Hogs Digital Community using platforms like Discord to help coordinate fans & their support towards Jon, Dluxe & Crabtree during the 2023 #Underhogs Campaign
    - Mario will also begin training Community Managers from India & Philippines. Developing Community Leads from different geographies will be key for building KH’s international presence & developing trust from these sub-communities. Note: a budget for these Community Manager candidates will come in separate proposal.
- Fan Content Creation Hub
    - March-May 2023 the [1st cohort of Mochi](https://twitter.com/bondwithmochi/status/1657068656105496578?s=20) netting the DAO a new energized group of fans from India & the Philippines for content creation focused on the KH Journey. [Here](https://twitter.com/bondwithmochi/status/1657068656105496578)’s the summary from the first cohort.
    - We have been invited to run a 2nd cohort with Mochi with a focus on the BIG3 Ball Hogs and Mario intends to facilitate this cohort with 30 members from India & Philippines.
- Social Media Management
    - Managing KH Socials including:
        - Engaging the basketball community via KH [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KrauseHouseDAO) (2-3 posts/week)
        - Regular KH [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/krausehouse_nba/) Posts (2-3 posts/week)
            - Also, growing & building organic relationships with brands & influencers through our Instagram (countless DMs for BD - tough to put a # on here)
        - KH LinkedIn posts to help grow our presence and credibility on the platform. By increasing our presense and sharing our stories on this platform we will be able to connect with more brands & professionals (2-3 posts/week drafted & shared to Shanny who is an admin of the KH LinkedIn)
    - Ball Hogs Socials:
        - Supporting Uncle Jon & Dluxe with the BIG3 Ball Hogs [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BIG3_BallHogs) & [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/big3_ballhogs/)
- Community Recognition Program
    - We’ve learned a lot about the pros/cons of platforms like Coordinape. The general thought is that Coordinape is great but can be full of friction for the average basketball fan (thinking of the 12 years old that roll through here).
    - I will devise a plan that recognizes community members with rewards like $KRAUSE governance tokens, basketball memorbilia and shoutouts… it will be full of human touch at first but if there is a tool that fits our needs, I will onboard KH to it and manage it (maybe Shreya’s platform).
- Partnerships
    - Fostering relationships with new partners for KH that add value to our community and the overall KH vision (see Past Work section for an example of those partnerships already closed)
- Community Reporting
    - weekly community highlights & governance roundups via Jerry’s Digest [Podcasts](https://open.spotify.com/show/3gY5N7rBd4oXn6vLKIoqti) (1/week) & [Newsletters](https://jerrysdigest.substack.com/) (1/week)

Mario will provide weekly projects updates in #member-chat with notes on progress, blockers & support areas
