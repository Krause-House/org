### ELI5 (Explain it Like I’m 5) Project Value-Add

Our general counsel (Jonathan Ip) has requested to be paid in $KRAUSE instead of a stablecoin, this proposal requests a payment (and future payments) to Jonathan via $KRAUSE. 

### Requested Budget:

25,000 $KRAUSE 

### How will funds be used?

To pay our general counsel (Jonathan Ip) for legal costs associated with Krause House DAO and our Panamanian Foundation. 

### How will funds be managed?

As our general counsel invoices us, we’ll record the expenses and track the total budget via Utopia.
