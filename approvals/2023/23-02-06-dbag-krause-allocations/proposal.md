### Context

Dbag recently submitted a [proposal for a 2 month stream](https://snapshot.org/#/krausehouse.eth/proposal/0x952ffd125cb502ab9545153d60b8d8720816fa471592d80e835fce4890fd1d01).  Due to miscommunication between Stewards about norms, he agreed to forgo fixed KRAUSE.  This proposal seeks to amend that by attaching a KRAUSE allocation to his compensation.

### Proposal

- 3000 KRAUSE / month
- 2 month
