Krause Picks launched just under 2 weeks ago and has thus far seen massive traffic and engagement across other communities. This proposal allows the DAO to continue building on Krause Picks’ early success with further development.

**************Budget:************** See “Options” for a list of the potential costs for Krause House.

****************Duration****************: This project will last 6 months unless otherwise paused or canceled based on the scenarios provided below.

******This proposal is for future development of the platform and in no way represents retroactive compensation for any work done up to this point.*

## Background

In under 2 weeks, Krause Picks has seen **1,200 site visitors**, **200 signups**, **over 5,000 picks made,** and **an average of 75 DAUs**. This was done with minimal marketing, user retargeting, or automated outreach (all features that could be implemented with this proposal). The majority of these users are not crypto natives and represent an audience of basketball fans that Krause House has long struggled to reach.

The app's current state was built by Greg (@gregfromstl) as a side project to build on past experiments with Pick ‘Em games within Krause House. The project has now reached a point where it can continue to exist as a small win for the DAO or act as a catalyst for stronger engagement, partnerships, and example-setting for Krause House’s potential.

## Options

**Option A: The project remains in its current state. - $0 / month**

The project will see no further features or improvement and will remain as it stands today for the rest of the season. Greg will continue to distribute daily prizes to those who participate.

**Option B: The project continues to develop at a rate of 25 hours per week - Basic Plan - $6,600 / month**

Greg and his team at Be Water Labs will further develop, maintain, and steward the project. New features and partnerships (listed below) will be aggressively pursued to further Krause House’s reputation, engagement, and inroads within the basketball community.

**Option C: The project continues to develop at a rate of 40 hours per week - Premium Plan - $9,000 / month**

Greg and his team at Be Water Labs will further develop, maintain, and steward the project with a significant level of commitment. New features and partnerships (listed below) will be aggressively pursued to further Krause House’s reputation, engagement, and inroads within the basketball community.

***********************These options represent a ~33% reduction of Be Water’s typical rates.***********************

### What do the time commitments amount to?

What does ************************************25 hours/week************************************ or ******************************40 hours/week****************************** look like? For context, the current state of the app was developed in approximately 40 hours of work. The amount of deliverables varies depending on complexity, but both these options will allow for significant progress to be made in a short period.

## Planned Partnerships

We’ve also been in discussions with some notable groups interested in partnering on the project.

- Playground & the NBA
    - Playground has partnered with the NBA and several individual players to create performance-based NFTs. NFTs evolve traits based on player, team, or other stats. We’ve held multiple discussions with Playground on how we can put Krause Picks rewards on-chain.
    - Playground also manages the NBA’s Discord. We’ve discussed building a Discord integration to use in the NBA’s server.
- Dapper Labs (Creators of TopShot)
    - Our largest community partner, B2B, has discussed the project with Dapper Labs, who have demonstrated interest in partnering with us. We’re currently working on a pitch to closely partner with Dapper and TopShot.
- Playback
    - Playback is a sports streaming platform and home to many NBA-focused communities. Our community partner B2B has a large audience on Playback and close ties with their team. We’re currently in the planning phase of potential Playback integrations.

## Direction

The following will serve as the general guide posts and direction for the project, while allowing opportunity for open-ended exploration of what works based on user feedback. The main objectives of the project are:

- To explore fantasy-like experiences and how they can be augmented with web3, while remaining accessible to every day audiences
- To leverage these experiences for fan loyalty and engagement from a team perspective, and how they can improve a team’s bottom line

## Cancellation

If the project fails to gain further traction or needs to be discontinued or modified for any reason, this proposal can be canceled at any time by a majority vote of the Stewards.

## How will Funds be Used?

Krause House will be invoiced by Be Water Labs before the beginning of each month. This invoice will be due within 2 weeks of issuance. If the invoice is not paid by the deadline, a late fee of 10% per week will be applied to the invoice.

## Ownership

All produced assets and work will be fully owned by Krause House. This includes everything thus far (effective on receipt of the first payment). Be Water reserves the right to use all work developed in marketing materials.

## Be Water Operating Practices

The following is an overview of how Be Water operates for all projects, including Krause Picks, should this proposal pass.

### Who will work on the project?

The project will be designated a minimum of one developer, one designer, and a project lead. The project lead will be Greg for this project. Bandwidth is managed closely and projects are limited for each team member, so everyone has time and capacity to give the project the attention it needs.

### Updates

The project team meets internally daily for premium plan projects, and twice per week for basic plan projects.

The project team meets weekly (premium) or bi-weekly (basic) to plan the upcoming sprint and designate upcoming tasks. Any Krause House member is welcome to sit in on these meetings.

Before each sprint planning session, a representative from Krause House will meet with the project lead to discuss updates and direction.

Every Friday (or every other if basic plan), Be Water will share a “changelog”, detailing all shipped improvements to the project.

## How votes will be counted

If Option A has greater than 50% of votes, Option A will pass.

Otherwise, the greater of Option B and C will pass.

This takes into account that a vote for Option C (Premium Plan), is also a vote for Option B.
