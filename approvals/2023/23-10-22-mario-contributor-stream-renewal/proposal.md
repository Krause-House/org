## **TL;DR - Contributor Value-Add**

Mario’s proposal ended Sept 30 and is looking to renew beginning Oct 23.

Mario’s renewal will have an emphasis on the following areas over the next period:

- Community Management & Communications
    - Sharing announcements to community members across relevant platforms and continue being a support mechanism for all KH members
    - Continuing managing the KH Discord Community, fielding questions sync & async in public & private channels
    - Helping facilitate key KH projects & contributors
    - Launch and run daily NBA engagement activities: NBA Pick Em in partnership with B2B, In The Lab and some TBA sports community partners
    - Launch other sports engagement activities based on KH direction and demand ex. soccer/futbol pick em, NFL pick em. Also, proactively partner with values aligned communities to grow our presence should we proceed with launching any of these sports activities.
    - Launch Krause House’s partnership with Striker Manager 3 contingent the Striker Manager 3 proposal [passing](https://www.notion.so/Permit-the-usage-of-Krause-House-IP-in-Striker-Manager-3-d322bb526e944e928ddc35ecec30231e?pvs=21).
- Fan Content Creation Hub
    - With Mario’s expertise managing cohorts 1 & 2 of the Fan Content Creation Hub in partnership with Mochi, we will run a 3rd cohort with content creators from India & Philippines. The goal will be to surpass Season #2’s success.
    - Mochi Season #2 Recap - Here’s the performance of what was done previous cohort managed by Mario:
        - Total videos = 195
        - Base rate = $10 * 195 = $1,950 or 1,083 $OP
        - Bonus $OP = 511 (views over 100, 200, 400)
        - Total cost = $2,870 or 1,594 $OP
        - Views = 744,042
        - Mille = Views / 1,000 = 744.042
        - CPM = $2,870/744.042 = $3.86
        
        If we include the whole $5k budget as the total cost, that's still a $6.72 CPM, which is still 33% cheaper than the "industry"

- Social Media Management
    - Manage & Support KH Social Presence including:
        - Engaging the basketball community with NBA pick em related posts via KH [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KrauseHouseDAO) & sharing any updates where appropriate
        - Regular KH [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/krausehouse_nba/) Posts + Stories to grow the brand
            - Also, growing & building organic relationships with brands & influencers through our Instagram (countless DMs for BD - tough to put a # on here)
- Partnerships
    - Fostering relationships with new & existing partners for KH that add value to our community and the overall KH vision (see Past Work section for an example of those partnerships already closed). These partners may be suitable for helping AIFS with its mission as previously identified with some notable basketball creators and influencers.
- Community Reporting
    - Weekly community highlights & governance roundups via Jerry’s Digest [Newsletters](https://jerrysdigest.substack.com/) (1/week). Note: Mario has paused doing the podcast because he noticed the lack of engagement and listeners compared to the Newsletter.

Mario will provide weekly projects updates in #member-chat with notes on progress, blockers & support areas
