### ELI5 (Explain it Like Iâ€™m 5)  Value-Add

Having worked with the DAO on the NFT NYC experiences team and now as a steward and partnerships/sponsorships lead for All In For Sport, I see an opportunity to collaborate more broadly with those working on project streams for Krause House. Working closely with the core team, and DAO members, my work is proposed to encompass the following:

- Attend weekly strategy meetings now scheduled during the DIO weekly meet hours.
- Work with project teams to develop their ideas, connect them with potential partners that we have built relationships with through KH and AIFS.
- Assist with developing actionable next steps for project streams.
- Look for opportunities for collaboration and cross sectoral support.
- Attend meetings with Core team on leads for potential partnerships and sponsorships.
- Develop partner pitches with core team members to further strengthen provide consistency across new and existing relationships.

### Requested Budget:

- 5000 $KRAUSE / month
- Estimated 10hrs per week
- 6 Months starting June 1/2023

### How will funds be used?

This allocation of $KRAUSE will be used to recognize and compensate my contribution to the DAO primarily on the strategy, partnership and sponsorship side. It will compensate my time for the following:

- attending weekly strategy calls - 2hrs per week.
- organizing and attending calls with potential leads.
- cultivating opportunities for the DAO aligned with our overall strategy.
- maintaining and updating Krause House LinkedIN.
