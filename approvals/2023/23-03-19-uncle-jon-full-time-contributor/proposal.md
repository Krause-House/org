# The Summary

Hello. Uncle Jon here. 

I am requesting $8000 USDC / month and 1000 $KRAUSE a month for 6 months beginning April 1, 2023 and ending Sept. 31, 2023.

This contributorship/retainer will be full-time and cover several different departments. 

- primary focus will be ideating with the community and preparing for Season 2 of the Ball Hogs Pig Pen.
- Additionally, I will continue to expand our community-run fan engagement experiments through our current partners, Overtime Elite and Karate Combat, while exploring options in other digital communities.

In our pursuit of NBA team ownership, Krause House's most relevant value proposition is the ability to rally fans into an enthusiastic online collective. Working alongside other stewards and our core team, my intention is to continue expanding our portfolio of successful projects, hoping that "Krause House" will be the first name that comes to mind for those seeking a strong and passionate internet fanbase. I‚Äôll also continue to become master ‚ÄúAdobe-Wan Kenobi‚Äù and create digital assets for us to use in the expansion of our social media presence.

# The Project Deets

### Big3 Ball Hogs Preparation:

The Big3 season is scheduled to officially kick off in June. This summer, the league is returning to its traditional touring style format, playing games at various venues across the Eastern U.S. Despite only having about a month of preparation, we were able to catch the attention and approval of the league and Mr. Ice Cube. This was a huge feat in and of itself. This year, TIME IS ON OUR SIDE BABY! We have 3 months to plan and execute on what is arguably a much bigger stage.

********************************************What needs to be done:********************************************

- Coordination with the league to get specifics on scheduling and where we can plug in
- Assembling a 1/2 Nationwide team of Jerry‚Äôs to show up and help execute pre-game hype for the Hogs.(sorry West Coast üôÅ)
- Building partnerships with non-profit organizations and AAU teams in each city the Big3 will be visiting
- Finishing editing and production of the Uncle Jon Podcast and aligning on content capture and creation for 2023 (lookin‚Äô at you @Crabtree)
- And a bunch of other stuff that is bound to come up üåé

### Very Rough Pig Pen Operations Estimate:

- Travel: 14k
- Lodging: 8k
- Assistant Budget: $5k
- Supplies: $10k
- Total = $37k

This is suuuuper rough. It could easily be scaled down or scaled up depending on what sort of activities we plan.

### Continuing Digital Community with our current partners (Karate Combat & Overtime Elite)

This winter, we established two great partner deals with Karate Combat and Overtime Elite, two fantastic sports organizations. With Overtime Elite, Mario and I started a Discord server for OTE team YNG Dreamerz. Essentially, we were international online basketball summer camp counselors (check out my LinkedIn).  What makes this project particularly cool is that we were initially brought on with the agreement that we would likely end our partnership at the end of the season. However, Overtime was so impressed with our work that they have kept us on for the offseason, and anticipate scaling up significantly next season (Fall 2023).

With Karate Combat, I produced and hosted a podcast to help explain what an MMA league embracing a DAO governance model means for its fans. This project was fantastic, and in summary, I worked with the league's founders and legal team to explain web3 concepts to people who know very little about web3. 

********************************************What needs to be done:********************************************

- Offseason Discord monitoring with the occasional fan activation for Overtime Elite
- Around June, we will circle back with Overtime and begin planning next season
- Releasing the already recorded Karate Combat episodes over the next 5 weeks (first one drops Mar 16)
- Beginning production on the Podcast‚Äôs second season

### Adobe-Wan Kenobi

Over the past few months I have been GRINDING away in attempts to become the DAO‚Äôs media creation king üëë. It‚Äôs a slow moving choo-choo train, but we‚Äôre getting there. 

********************************************What needs to be done:********************************************

- As Mario and Dbag scale out our online presence and social media involvement, I will assist in edits because everyone knows that ‚Äúmany hands make light work.‚Äù

### Working with Lewwwk to explore community services for teams

At Krause House we have an interesting opportunity to use what we‚Äôve learned helping other online sports communities. This is not only valuable for cap table presentations on what we offer to mid to small-market teams, but also, it brings a little $$ cha-ching into the treasury. We plan to explore this opportunity a bit more moving forward. Other than that this project is in its ‚Äúearly days‚Äù era, but stay tuned.

********************************************What needs to be done:********************************************

- standardizing our team offering
- templating our team and community onboarding
- signing out next team partnerships

# The WHY?

According to [Commodore's update](https://krausehouse.mirror.xyz/JUKeloohXfbbbFKad8nKw717sRYlylHwVrpncLFaiSE), we nearly became minority owners of the Suns. To illustrate this, let's use a baseball analogy:

- We‚Äôre at the plate with a 3-1 count, one out, and a runner on second.
- We‚Äôre down one run, probably in the 7th inning. We've faced this pitcher before and we're confident that he's going to throw a juicy fastball right down the middle.
- Our average against him on fastballs in that part of the zone is .450, which is pretty good, but we could still strike out.

There are arguments to be made for both swinging big in a batter's count, or being safe and risking a strike by taking the pitch, which would bring us to a full count with less certainty than before the last pitch.

As a community, we are CLOSE and it should be noted that in order to help whichever team we end up with, we need to continue strengthening our online community building muscle. I like to think of that muscle as my quads, so I'm in the gym hitting a million deadlifts. 

Both projects I've been involved with, between the Big3 and OTE/KC and the Philippines court refurb, have showcased in-real-life and digital fan experiences, and as a community, we've done fantastically with both. Let's keep our foot on the gas, my dudes and lady dudes.
