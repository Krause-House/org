**TL;DR - Contributor Value-Add**

A core contributor since Day 1, Bayesian is back and eager as ever to serve the Krause House community in 2024!

After a busy summer repping KH in the BIG3, coaching alongside NBA legend Rick Barry, and helping the Ball Hogs to their most successful season ever, I took the Fall off from my regularly scheduled contributor streams to reset, recharge, and refocus on how to continue my contributions to Krause House in the most meaningful ways possible.

Over the past several months, I’ve spent a considerable amount of time observing, reflecting, and thinking deeply about the highest impact opportunities, and determined that I would like focus on three primary goals moving forward: (1) re-energizing our community, (2) building new partnerships, and (3) getting back to the creative principles upon which Krause House was established.

In the past, I’ve contributed on a variety of fronts -- including everything from media and podcasting, to coaching and analytics, as well as, product and strategy. These are core my strengths, and I would love to continue using them to inch us closer to our collective mission in 2024 and beyond!

**What will Bayesian Baller focus on during this contributor stream?**

**1) Re-Energizing The Community w/ Exclusive Original Content**

**TLDR:**

- Season 3 of the Around The Association Podcast
- Exclusive Original Content Promoting Krause Picks

Since January 2022, I’ve been the Host & Executive Producer of **[Around The Association](https://open.spotify.com/show/3YadlLpwrMTOG0ecvX65bw)**, the official basketball podcast of Krause House DAO & the first podcast launched by a non-steward under the community's media network.

From Day 1 my intent with Around The Association has been to drive community engagement, demonstrate Krause House's basketball acumen, as well as, break down the barrier to entry into Web3 and get everyday hoops fans interested in DAOs.

In addition to launching Season 3 of Around The Association, my vision for the next several months centers around creating exclusive, original content that promotes other KH products in which the community has invested. The specific product that I would like to support is Krause Picks.

In speaking with Greg, the user base has remained very loyal, highly engaged, and optimistically consistent since its inception, as we continue to award daily prizes despite minimal day-to-day promotion. I think a great community-built and branded product like this deserves its own exclusive, dedicated content that gets pushed out and published across Krause House socials.

The idea would be to produce weekly content -- primarily in the form short-form videos -- that previews and recaps the week’s slate of games, analyzes top performances and league-wide trends, as well as, shouts out the winners and gives recommendations on how to pick certain games. Think about how media companies like ESPN and FanDuel use original shows (like Daily Wager) and personalities (like Shams Charania) to promote their sports betting products. By tying content to an existing product in which the DAO has already invested major time and resources, I believe we can maximize its potential and see some major dividends.

**2) Spearheading New Partnerships w/ Prospective Teams & Leagues**

**TLDR:**

- Generate Leads & Investment Opportunities for KH Capital
- Spearhead Collaboration w/ Prospective Euro Basketball Club

Since Day 1 of joining Krause House, I’ve opened up my personal and professional networks to connect our community with a variety of opportunities and prospective partnerships in the sports industry. In the DAO’s early days, this included partnering with the Big Ten Conference to crowdsource basketball content in exchange for KH bounties. More recently, this has included orchestrating connections for Krause House Capital with opportunities in the collegiate sports and international basketball markets. The latter, of which, has particularly heated up lately and in my opinion presents the greatest immediate opportunity to our community.

More specifically, over the past several months I’ve been working closely with a group of investors and former athletes who are actively engaged in the acquisition of a top-tier French basketball club. If the acquisition is successful, it would open up a floodgate of opportunities for Krause House to participate in a Ball Hogs 2.0 style collaboration with the franchise -- ranging everywhere from community building and court refurbishments throughout Europe to basketball operations and front office type contributions to the immediate team.

**3) Restoring The Community’s Creative Juices w/ Product Design & Merchandising**

********TLDR:********

- Organize Exclusive Merchandise Campaigns
- Design & Develop Premium KH Collectibles

With a focus on engaging our community and getting back to the creative principles upon which Krause House was built, I would like to lead a merchandising initiative that not only sees reruns of past KH staples, but also features exclusive drops of premium collectibles. Product ideas include letterman jackets, caricature tees, vintage snapbacks, and performance gear among others. The strategy would revolve around pre-orders to maximize margins and ensure profitability, and rest assured that any initiative would certainly need its own additional proposal in order to proceed (similar to the recently approved proposal to order more of the famous KH basketball shorts).

I think Krause House-branded merch presents enormous opportunities. Having been on the ground in all of the BIG3 cities and having seen how the Ball Hogs players and fans obsessed over the merch that Uncle Jon and the team created was one of the coolest experiences ever. Players from other teams would literally come up to us at the hotels and in the arenas telling us that the Ball Hogs and Krause House had BY FAR the best merch of any team in the BIG3, and that they wanted us to create their team’s merch, as well. There is serious opportunity here that, if properly explored, could potentially expand beyond making merch just for our immediate community. Think “In The Lab” style opportunities.
