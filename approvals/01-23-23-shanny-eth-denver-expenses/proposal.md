[Shanny ETH Denver Expenses] Budget $2000USDC

Author: Shanny

### ELI5 (Explain it Like I’m 5) Project Value-Add

I am requesting $2000 USDC to cover expenses to travel to ETH Denver on behalf of All In For Sport and Krause House DAO.

I have been a part of the All In For Sport initiative since the initial gitcoin round in September 2022. Since then our team has made some great progress:

- Formed a governance and sponsorships/partnerships cell
- Developed a strategy and vision for AIFS
- Partnered with Gitcoin to build our quadratic funding mechanism on their new protocol
- Working closely with Krause House connects such as In The Lab to bring in community partners to support/promote this work.

### Requested Budget:

- $2000USDC

### How will funds be used?

- Coverage of flights and hotels from Calgary to Denver. Dates are from March 1-5 2023

### Team

- Shanny

### Project Details

Travel to ETH Denver will provide the following for AIFS.

- Announcement of our beta grants round in tandem with Gitcoin in announcing their grants protocol.
- Attend ETH Denver (ticket already sponsored $500 value) and attend day sessions. This will allow me to connect/network with others building in the public goods sector.
- Bring awareness to AIFS and Krause House’s support of this project by attending events/dinners targeting sponsors. As a member of Boys Club, SheFi, Arkive, FWB and Chainforest communities the ability to network across many channels is vast.
- Launching AIFS at ETH Denver will bring awareness of our beta rounds to a crypto native demographic. While we are building to onboard community partners and projects, this connection and support from the crypto space is essential to raise the initial funds to allow our beta rounds to be successful. The spin off from this is proof of concept will be that we can then show this to larger sponsors that we have been in early conversations with in hopes to onboard them for future rounds.

## How does this benefit Krause House?

- AIFS as an arms length organization in the philanthropic space supports the value proposition Krause House pitching to ownership groups around the unique opportunity Krause House presents by being on their cap table by being able to engage and interact with a global audience that is beyond their reach.
- Krause House has already been approached by groups doing grassroots work in areas like the Philippines and Guatemala to support local initiatives. While not in KH’s mandate, having AIFS help raise funding and awareness to projects allows KH to capture the media/content side. This connection brings AIFS and KH closer to sponsors, supporters and most importantly - the FANS of Sport.
