NBA Pick Em 2023-2024 Budget

Author Name: Mario, Greg

### ELI5 (Explain it Like I’m 5) Project Value-Add

Requesting an initial budget of $10 per day for the NBA 2023-2024 season + a bonus budget contingent on milestones.

The $10 cash equivalent will go to the daily pick em winner, hosted by the fans of Krause House.

Requesting a small up front budget and afterwards, budget is sent it out upon key KPIs being accomplished.

### Requested Budget:

$10 per day in form of USDT/USDC/DAI to Greg who will be distributing rewards in form of gift cards or cash equivalent.

$10 x 173 days = $1730 total budget up front upon proposal passing to Seed the activity and attract users

Season starts Oct 24 and ends April 14 (173 days)

NOTE: An *additional* $10 per day will be provided by our friends, Boards2Buckets as they are excited to partner with us on the Season long endeavour. They will send a lump sum total of to the KH Treasury at the end of each month. ex. Nov 30, $300 USDC will be sent to KH Treasury.

### Bonus Budget based on KPI:

KPI: We propose as $1700 as the base budget and then move up five dollars for every additional 100 members the Pick Em attracts around the world. 

Payment made upon the additional members milestone being complete.

For example:

Month 1 (starting Nov): 100 users —> KH still pays $10/day
Month 2 (Dec): 200 users —> KH pays $15/day
Month 3 (Jan): 400 users —> KH pays $25
etc.

### How will funds be used? Who/what will it go to?

### How will funds be managed?

By Greg who will be providing non-cash rewards like [NBA.com](http://NBA.com) gift cards.

### Team Members Assigned to the Project

- Mario, Greg, Dream from B2B & Top Shot

### Project Details

Krause House, B2B and In The Lab will collaborate on a 2023-2024 NBA Pick Em

After the success of the FIBA Pick Em which saw 150+ users around the world and nearly 4000 picks made, we would like to increase the stakes for users by providing $10 daily winnings to the top Pick Em Player of the Day! 

### Why $10 per day cash equivalent prizes?

We noticed most Pick Ems do pay outs at the end of the season and as a result, users lose engagement. However, if we provide prizes daily, we can build increased daily engagement throughout the 173 days of the NBA season!

# Top Shot Packs + Game Streams

In addition to the $10 per day, we are in discussions with our NBA fan communities to have prizes such as NBA Top Shot moments, NBA tickets and merch for users. These prizes will be announced as the season progresses.

### Top Shot Moments & Packs as prizes

B2B has already committed to provided $10/day to add to the pool and also will provide Top Shot Packs & Moments to top performers on the weekly leaderboards.

### Game Streams 3-5/week!

Another cool aspect is Dream, leader of B2B, will be hosting 3-5 Playback stream nights as an official partner. He’ll be streaming NBA League Pass games and providing rewards for viewers who tune in. 

The KH community is more than welcome to join the streams to win some more prizes, enjoy the fun and see how their picks are doing.

## More on the way…

In the future, we are looking to collaborate with the premium basketball game community ([International Basketball Manager 23](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2098130/International_Basketball_Manager_23/)) & the Soccer Weekly Pick EM via the UPlay Managed Discords.

We are also in early discussions with Overtime’s Discord to participate in the Daily Pick Em.

### Clause

If any for any reason this projects progress isn’t going well, Mario, Greg, Stewards & anyone in the community can make a proposal to shut down the project and return any outstanding funds.
