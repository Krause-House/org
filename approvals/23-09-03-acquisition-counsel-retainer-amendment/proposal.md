**Context**

The Krause House community [approved a $25,000 legal counsel retainer](https://snapshot.org/#/krausehouse.eth/proposal/0x60b27939db69c29cd8dd7c5320d217428cc5182e2d7329ee848f8dc851ff9632) on March 27, 2023. Since that time conversations with ownership groups have expanded beyond the NBA, to groups that are excited to bring the Krause House playbook into their sport.

**Details**

This proposal requests to amend the original proposal as follows:

1. apply the retainer budget to acquisition opportunities in any league generating over $1B in annual revenues.
2. pledge that the retainer will be repaid to the community from proceeds of any resulting transaction subsequently approved by the community.

**Rationale**

While Krause House began with a focus on the NBA, it is apparent that our value proposition extends across sport. Securing an LOI with any team in an elite league will be a material contribution to our mission.
