### Project Details

The idea is to tell Krause House & the Ball Hog’s unique story, through one of our most unique & interesting Jerrys: Uncle Jon. Uncle Jon has a unique path through our DAO & incredible stories of working closely on the ground at the BIG3 games. We’d like to explore:

- The life of Uncle Jon
- How he became Uncle Jon
- Krause House’s influence on utilizing his passion
- The stories of the Ball Hogs
- Behind the scenes at the BIG3
- The ups & downs of Uncle Jon’s life to how he got here
- What happens next?

We think that using long form audio is an excellent medium to experiment with web3 storytelling. During our pitch with one particular NBA team, the idea of having a decentralized community help deliver fan generated content was an exciting prospect. This podcast would provide us a decentralized fan generated content example in our pitches to NBA teams. Additionally, there’s a realistic chance that this podcast is generally well loved broadly — this is why we choose Uncle Jon + telling our story.

We feel that Uncle Jon is a unique enough character to use as a vehicle to highlight the value of Krause House & our asset the Ball Hogs. We think this is a superior strategy than simply doing a podcast outlining what Krause House & the Ball Hogs is.

The creative vision is something akin to The Last Dance detailing a biographical.

Further production begins as soon as proposal is passed.
