### Project Value-Add

200,000 $KRAUSE to lock in Partnerships with NBA Players & Athletes

Decisions will be made in majority by the committee.

## What does success look like?

Over the next 3 months, Krause House will have 3+ NBA player Ambassadors (note: this could consist of current or retired)

As part of the partnership & ambassador agreement, the NBA players will be obligated to:

- Engaging/sharing Krause House’s in-house content creation: podcasts, streams, TV shows, etc
- Making live appearances at Krause House IRL & URL experiences/engagements
- Organically extending an invite to their NBA & athlete network to join the Krause House community

++ any other deliverables that provide enduring mutual value.

## How will we determine what’s a good ambassador

Qualitative: 

- NBA players who see the vision of what we are crafting as a community & share similar values
- Are looking to enter Web3 collaboratively with Krause House
- Are looking to leverage Web3 to grow their brand & bring them closer to their fans
- Are open to collaborating on philanthropic efforts
- Are interested in the various ownership opportunities Krause House can provide outside of the NBA

We are avoiding vanity metrics such as social media as they don’t necessarily correlate to authentically engaging with Krause House in a long-term manner.
