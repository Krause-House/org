**### Scope of Work**

This contributor stream request includes, but is not limited to work on the following:

********************OTE Digital Community Building********************

We have now established official buy in from OTE on our work facilitating the YNG Dreamerz Discord and digital community for the remainder of their season. We will have our offical kick-off stream on Jan. 13, which will be promoted from their YNG Dreamerz social media accounts. For the remainder of the season and post season I will be:

- Moderating the Discord (with the help of @Mario Lopes)
- Hosting and running fan activations digitally
- Creating media and engagement content (GIFs, memes, social posts)
- Building out onboarding framework utilizing Catapult.io, intros.io, and other CRM tools to measure engagement metrics.

Per this proposal, it will be made official in title only that @Greg’s official role is “Uncle Jon’s Boss”

This does not come with any additional power or control. It is just simply so Greg can say he is my “boss” to me and others.

### Work done so far

- The initial Discord server for the YNG Dreamerz has been assembled and can be joined via this link: [https://discord.gg/EK3at6rw](https://discord.gg/EK3at6rw)
- I built out a detailed [Notion database](https://www.notion.so/OTE-Basketball-704d7ca09e064ed1a6db5550713ffa09) that documents tasks needed to be done and a content calendar
- Communication through @Flex Chapman to OTE requesting assets and detailing our approach to growing a strong online basketball fanbase

### Didn’t you just put up a proposal for this last month?

I did, however, I only set the length of it for one month, this proposal will last until the end of the OTE season.

For this project, OTE is paying the Krause House treasury per a contract we are under with them. There is then a 100% pass through to Uncle Jon’s wallet as comp so there is not net loss from the KH treasury.

### Why does this project matter?

This project is a massive credibility continuation with Overtime, which is a sports media/league group that has a significant following. After our initial work with them this last month, they have allocated much of their resources to helping us promote the newly created Discord community from their social media accounts.

We have already proven ourselves after the work done this summer with the Big3 and IRL fan activations and now the ball is in our metaphorical court to do the same type of work digitally. As the boasted “internet’s home team”, a large part of our value driver with front offices is the ability to tap into online communities both in the states and internationally. We have been given free reign to experiment ideas and what we uncover during this project will bolster our eminence in the marriage of web3 and sports.

**### Specification**

This contributor may submit a request for *up to* the specified amount based on self-assessment of their work.

**### Intention**

This is intended to encourage contributors to take immediate action on a wide range of problems/opportunities, as opposed to proceeding through the slower process of submitting a proposal for a narrow scope of work.

We prefer to invest in and groom talent, giving *them* the freedom and capital they need to be entrepreneurs within our community.  We value self-starters who are able to take action and deliver quality work.

**### bUt SomEb0dY m1gHt t@kE t0o mUçh**Both the community and the Stewardship team has the power to cancel this stream if it is being abused.  In addition, if a contributor abuses this trust, they are effectively burning their social credibility and ability to successfully submit proposals in the future.  We expect some lossiness; however, we believe the benefits of getting good work off the ground is worth this small cost.
