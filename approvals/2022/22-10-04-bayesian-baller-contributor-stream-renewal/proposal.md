### Funding Strategy + Stream Details:

**Scope of Work**

*A stream request is designed to give contributors freedom and encouragement to work across multiple domains across the DAO; however, here are the current main focuses / intentions:*

### 1) **Krause House Analytics x NBA Pitches**

Bayesian Baller will continue working alongside Flex Chapman, Greg, Trik, and the Product Team to perform data science research and build unique NBA analytics projects for prospective NBA partners. The past two months Bayesian has been working on an in-depth analytics project for Krause House’s pitch to the Indiana Pacers to showcase the community’s technical skills and ability to contribute legitimate basketball analysis to the Pacers’ Front Office & Basketball Analytics department.

### 2) Ball Hogs x BIG3 Basketball Analytics

Over the summer, Bayesian Baller spearheaded the basketball analytics initiatives for the Ball Hogs during the 2022 BIG3 season. This included building data-driven scouting reports on a weekly basis for HC Rick Barry and the players to use for game-planning purposes. What started as weekly pre-game scouting reports eventually grew to include post-game reports, as well as, direct conversations with Rick Barry and Ball Hogs players about using analytics to implement actionable in-game strategies. Below are some examples of Bayesian’s work for the Ball Hogs this summer:

### 3) **Around The Association Podcast**

Research, record, produce, and market 2-4 podcast episodes per month that drive community engagement, demonstrate the community’s basketball acumen, break down the barrier to entry to get non-crypto fans interested in Web3 / DAOs, and generate ad revenue for the Krause House treasury.
