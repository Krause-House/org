## [EXAMPLE] Product Team Proposal

Summary
We propose the ratification of an official team for product development within Krause House. This team’s sole purpose will be to build products that give Krause House the greatest chance of survival. The team will include a variety of developers, designers, and PMs, 75% of which must be full-time. This requirement will allow the team to operate much like a traditional startup with daily standups, weekly retrospectives, etc. The team will operate as transparently as possible to allow for proper performance evaluation. We are requesting $20K + 10K KRAUSE / month in initial funding for 2 developers. Both these developers are already on streams of similar value, so this would incur a minimal increase in monthly cost to the DAO. This ratification and funding will require renewal by a vote every 3 months.

Note: This funding listed in this proposal will retroactively begin August 1, 2022

Purpose
The Product Team’s objective is to build products that give Krause House the greatest chance of survival. This mission is intentionally vague, as we’d like to maintain the ability to pivot as needed. However, it’s important to note what gives Krause House the greatest chance of survival (and world domination) involves a constant dialogue between the Product Team’s leadership and token-holders.

Evaluating Team Performance
The team will operate with high transparency, especially in determining and reporting on goals to help the DAO accurately evaluate the team’s performance. Each project will have roadmaps, timelines, and resources made publicly available to members of the DAO. Major team decisions and calls will be published to the #announcements channel on Discord, and the team will report on progress at Krause House’s weekly town halls.

DAO members should use this information when evaluating the team’s renewals. If at any time a Krause House member feels they do not have sufficient information to evaluate the team’s performance, they should let the team know along with any suggestions for improvement. However, the team is not required to follow said suggestions but is required to make an effort towards providing the information when possible.

Operations
The team will operate as close to a standard startup as possible. We will conduct daily stand-up meetings, weekly retrospectives, peer-to-peer reviews, etc. We will also require that 75% or more of team members work for the Product Team full time. Finally, we will establish a 6-hour time window in which all team members must be online MWF. This does not imply team members will only be working during those windows (see full-time requirement), but to create blocks of time in which communication is easiest. This will minimize blockers and communication bottlenecks that are rampant in DAOs. Team members will aim to produce the highest quality work they are capable of.

Projects will be determined and prioritized based on the DAO’s best interests at the time and the current opportunities available to us. While this is somewhat abstract, it is meant to enable flexibility based on where Krause House is and where it is headed. All major decisions will involve consultations with the stewards (most notably Flex who will serve as a member of the Product Team), token-holders, and the end users for a proposed product.

Note: In the early stages, the team will only have the capacity for one project at a time and will place a premium on focus.

Members will be paid through Utopia.

Initial Team
Any team member must be explicitly added to the Product Team through a proposal. Ratification and renewal proposals can act as this proposal, or they may be added through a separate proposal. Once a team member has been officially added through a proposal that confirms their working status to be within the requirements of the Product Team, they can begin receiving compensation from the Product Team’s funding.

We propose the following individuals to be the Product Team’s initial members:

Flex Chapman - Adviser

gregfromstl - Development & Design

Commitment: Full-time (minimum 40 hours per week, as before)

Compensation: $12K + 5K KRAUSE monthly (continuation of previous stream + 1k KRAUSE)

Trik - Development

Commitment: Full-time (minimum 40 hours per week, increase from part-time)

Compensation: $8K + 5K KRAUSE monthly

While the team is small, members will operate across specialties to fill any gaps in design and product management. Greg has experience in both areas and Flex will assist in product management along the way.
