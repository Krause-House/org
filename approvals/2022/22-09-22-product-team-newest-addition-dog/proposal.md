**Author: Dogstoesvky**

## Summary

Propose adding Dogstoevsky to the Product Team. Dogstoevsky will support the team and its existing products as needed in domains such as:

- User research
- Product/project management
- External outreach
- Business development

---

### Requested Budget

- 8000 USDC / month
- 5000 $KRAUSE / month
- 4 months —> October, November, December, January

This funding (beyond October) is contingent on the Product Team’s renewal in November.

There will be a two week trial period where Product Team can ensure good team fit. 

Stewardship team may cancel this agreement at any point.

Community may submit a proposal to cancel this agreement at any point.

---

Dogstoevsky will follow the same operational principles as the existing product team members as outlined [here.](https://www.notion.so/Product-Team-04c0980af80a41e5b9e27dbe8bc6fa48) 

Dog’s primary focus will be on managing the external engagement and business side of the product team. The goal will be to allow the engineers to stay hyper focused on technical problems while a direct line of communication can still be maintained between the DAO and Product Team (via Dog). 

As part of the product team, Dogstoevsky will still contribute to other areas that are outside of the product team (either in scope or business function), such as finishing the MyJerry BETA and MVP (which is technically a product but outside the product team’s existing initiatives). 

Dogstoevsky will also continue to participate as a Steward and will be helping several contributors get proposals together as the Contributor Ops Streams are wrapped up. 

### Previous Work and Vouching

Dogstoevsky worked closely with Greg and Trik over the summer while building the Ball Hogs [rewards program](http://scan.ballhogs.club) and they believe he will work well with them on their product initiatives.

Dogstoevsky has been helping out for about 11 months in Krause House and across a lot of different initiatives. Some of the more recent projects include:

- MyJerry (current)
- Krause House Consulting (current)
- Contributor Ops (ending in September)
- Ball Hogs Rewards Program: app/strategy/logistics
- Project Management support for projects
- Onboarding processes and the Agents team

I’ve also provided some lighter support this summer to other projects like:

- Uncle Jon’s IRL Ball Hogs adventures, Krause House University, partnerships, research and development, and more.
