### Project Details

The clear value prop of Krause House Capital / DIO is collective intelligence. Collective intelligence enables high quality deal flow from around the world, extremely talented individuals in specialized verticals and the ability to assist portfolio companies with unique and difficult road blocks.

As Krause looks to implement the strategy voted on in previous soft consensus voting ([https://snapshot.org/#/krausehouse.eth/proposal/0x97f85099d9e0727fe49f31638e9e42d4148478ace5f88aab5147efc29494fd11](https://snapshot.org/#/krausehouse.eth/proposal/0x97f85099d9e0727fe49f31638e9e42d4148478ace5f88aab5147efc29494fd11)), we need to build a worldwide picture of investment opportunities in both venture and sport. Krause House Capital will look to not only purchase ownership in NBA teams, but purchase ownership in international teams across various leagues, invest in high growth projects shaping the current sports landscape and make venture investments in the future of sports.

To manage this massive task, we propose to create a bounty project to allow current Krause House members and external contributors to create investment memos for a wide range of categories. Allow individuals to show their expertise and build the collective intelligence of Krause House to assist in investment exploration including international exploration.

The categories we will look to explore are showed in the following figma:

**Implementation**

Bounty board on [Wonderverse.xyz](http://Wonderverse.xyz) to incentives both internal and external collaboration. Having met with Wonderverse, they have agreed work with us and push our bounties to their community of 17,000 Wonderverse contributors.

Will return all funds not used.

Investment memos will be heavily vetted by peterrr#4718 through a structured grading process. The investment memos will all follow a uniform structure to allow the research to be able to show relative value between investment categories. This is to ensure consistency and accuracy while maximizing decentralized intelligence.

**Expectations of Research Briefs**

Points outlined below will give a clear idea of what KH is to receive through the collection of research briefs

- Rating of relative indicators within investment category to create relative evaluation of investment potential between verticals, while quantitative results will allow comparison across categories, qualitative analysis will provide the context necessary when an opportunity is presented.
- Venture topics to be evaluated: innovation level; technical difficulty; connection to adjacent technologies; availability of opportunities; risk factors, economic overview; scope related to changing lives
- League topics to be evaluated: value drivers; risk factors; leagues relative strength; financial strength; key drivers of success for teams
- Team topics to be evaluated: value drivers; risk factors; team relative strength within league; financial strength; key drivers of success; fandom

**Indicators of Success**

- Expand Krause and DIO contributor base internationally
- Build investment opportunity wiki for future Krause House Capital investment explorations
- Receive high quality research from people world wide to better understand investment opportunities in sport and venture
- Support DEI groups though working with Gitcoin partners and promote Krause as a brand support DEI efforts in Web3
