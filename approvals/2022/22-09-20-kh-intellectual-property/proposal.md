**PROPOSED DAO NORM UPDATE**

Krause House DAO owns 100% of the IP for any of the projects that paid contributors have initiated and/or delivered.

**REASON**

Contributors that have received funding to work on Krause House DAO projects and have essentially been “incubated” by the DAO. To protect the DAO’s IP, Krause House DAO will retain 100% of the IP unless there is an explicit Joint Venture set up between the contributor and the DAO.

Note: For contributors that are not receive funding, they will be held under an expectation to set up licensing agreements with Krause House DAO.

Contributors seeking to retain the IP they’ve created under Krause House may make a proposal to the DAO 

**DURATION (if relevant)**

This proposal will take immediate effect and last indefinitely.

This proposal will also apply to any & all projects that were initiated prior to this proposal, including:

- Krause House DAO Podcast
- Around the Association Podcast
- Jerry’s Digest
- MyJerry
- Krause House Experiences + Events

Both the community and the Stewardship team have the power to cancel or modify this proposed DAO update via proposal.
