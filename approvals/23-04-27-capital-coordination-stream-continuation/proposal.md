- Engaging and managing capital partners, investors, advisors, and contributors

**Purpose of this Work**

Krause House formed around an ambitious mission to buy an NBA team. In less than two years, [weâ€™re on the doorstep](https://krausehouse.mirror.xyz/JUKeloohXfbbbFKad8nKw717sRYlylHwVrpncLFaiSE), and have learned a lot about [the value community can bring to ownership](https://krausehouse.mirror.xyz/Npqzilp1YpqAXzRRWtI6fcfYNHuexF98JceikKFFRD0) in the NBA, and professional sports more broadly.

This phase of the capital coordination stream is focused in on executing our first transactions and preparing to scale community-driven ownership across professional sports.

**Results from Previous Work**

Through work completed under the previous capital coordination streams Lewwwk, in collaboration with Commodore, Flex, and advisors: 

- designed an evergreen, multi-strategy investment platform, including compliant tokenization options for Fund 1 and future capital strategies
- handled administration of Krause House Capital including compliance registration and initial transaction infrastructure setup
- managed relationship with key advisors Luis Vicente and Michael Broughton
- engaged with team and league owners across sport, including pitch materials for Krause House community management services
- facilitated an introduction to an incoming NBA owner
- supported transaction readiness for two NBA ownership positions
- secured initial investment interest in fund, SPV, and NBA ownership opportunities
- secured NBA transaction counsel
- hosted weekly #dio-chats for interested members
- supported exploration of external capital options and spin-out strategies for [HeatCheck](https://heatcheck.club/); development of [All In For Sport](https://allinforsport.org/); and the Future of Sport roadmapping project

**What Changed Over the Last Stream**

Over the past stream we found ourselves on the doorstep of ownership as market conditions continued to deteriorate into the worst capital raising market in over a decade.

In response, attention shifted toward preparing and supporting potential NBA ownership positions; adapting the fund strategy; and accelerating work to bring the first SPV to our community to demonstrate what Krause House ownership will look like across sport. 

**What Does Success Look Like**

- An LOI signed for a minority ownership position in an NBA team
- Our first SPV complete for community investment into a sport team outside the NBA
