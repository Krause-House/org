# **Summary**

This is a redrafted proposal to the one that went through snapshot from 1/20-1/23 - found [here](https://snapshot.org/#/krausehouse.eth/proposal/0x871f3f4cffad9ddc5bd711c8e96905cc3979f7c11482e2c5efcc114e00e1fb5f). 

Krause House has accomplished a lot this past year but not enough of the basketball community knows or has heard about us. I’ve experienced this blocker in trying to raise sponsorships funds for events such as Krause Houe JAM @ [NFT NYC](https://youtu.be/i1Qy6WhAfmQ) / [Art Basel](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Clw8cDZjSTr/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) and in closing partnerships for Krause House. I believe we need to clarify/refine our narrative on socials like IG & TikTok and capture more stories on our journey to grow our following so our accomplishments go noticed. Having curated and executed on some of the key stories in Krause House’s journey, I feel most equiped to bring KH more visibilty. To do this I’m looking be on a monthly stream of 6000 USDC for two months to see if my methods can produce real results.

# **The Role**

**Marketing & business development** 

**Content Creation & Upkeep**
I will manage end-to-end creation of content which includes ideating, producing, editing, cross-promoting, copywriting and uploading to our social platforms. The content I will focus on producing will be around explaining our core mission in a digestable way. The goal is to capture the attention of a wider basketball audience.

Here’s an example of when I was on Sway Calloway, sharing Krause House’s Mission:

Here’s some other content I was the direct lead on:

- [Tech Runs Basel Event](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Clw8cDZjSTr/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)

**Assist in BD Relations** 

I will continue to form relationships for KH that will bring collaborative opportunities in content creation (podcasts, videos, etc) , events, court refurbs concepts, and sponsorships. My plan is to leverage our partner networks created since NFT NYC, inbound opprtunities through our social platforms and targeted cold outreach.  

Here’s some examples of relationships formed since NFT NYC:

- In The Lab
- Tech Runs
- Terance Mann
- Swish House
- Mike Swift

 

**Court Refurbs**

I will work with Shanny from AIFS to help close partnerships and also spread the AIFS’s court refurb initiative across socials by creating storytelling content.  

Here’s an example of what that may look like:

IRL Experiences 

I will source, scope and find funding for future Krause House events. This will involve discussing with all available partners and finding windows of time in the year to activate, developing a clear vision and pitching it to groups that have available funds and align with the vision. A big factor in landing sponsorships for events has to do with how much reach we have. Growing our reach will favor landing sponsors and being able to commit to events.

# **Proposal**

- A two month budget of 6000 USDC paid monthly.
- Wallet Address: 0xE97F19e5DF4e6dCa116c3097CE16a3bfFE891Cee
- Funds to be sent starting on Feb 1st  and at the start of each month.

**Protections:**

- Stewardship team may cancel this agreement at any point.
- Community may submit a proposal to cancel this agreement at any point.

# Intention

Our lack of visibility to the basketball world seems to be the biggest vulnerability in pitching to Front Offices. Our social presence also being top of the funnel for all our projects and opportunities it could use a singular member focus. My goal is to start with implementing a more consistent marketing strategy so we can grow our online presence. Here a few starting goals that i’ll have my eyes set on.

Goals: 

- Gain 5k IG & TikTok followers.
- Gain 2 more partners that is either content, sponsorship or court refurb related.

# Why DBAG

I bring a skillset of taste-making, execution & raising. Some of my past ventures include owning a production studio in LA, creating a platform for pop-up experiences pre pandemic, operations lead at redacted finance. Here’s some of the work I’ve already done for Kruase House.

Events & Marketing Proof of Work

- Krause House JAM @ [NFT NYC](https://youtu.be/i1Qy6WhAfmQ) -  I led the team of 10 to introduce the world’s 1st physical NFT basketball court and curate the most engaging event at NFT NYC 22.

- [Tech Runs Basel](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Clw8cDZjSTr/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) - I closed the deal with one of our partner community to curate and execute an event for them at Art Basel. I interacted and formed relations with [Nueral.io](http://Nueral.io), Ros Gold and NBA PA. My efforts in making this happen included creating all brand assets, marketing materials and creating a sponsorship deck that helped raise $45k in sponsorship funds. Also integrated Heat Check in of our activations so guests can earn XP.
