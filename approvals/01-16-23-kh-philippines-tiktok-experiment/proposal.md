Philippines Native NBA Content Experiment (TikTok) Budget

Author: Commodore

### ELI5 (Explain it Like I’m 5) Project Value-Add

Create a $2k USDC budget to run a Philippines NBA content experiment of 10-20 videos in Filipino. The goal is to demonstrate the appetite of Filipino market for NBA content to establish CPMs for this type of media. This is valuable because we can leverage the audience we build to test our international fan value proposition. 

### Requested Budget:

$2k USDC to be allocated via Utopia to a Filipino contractor. 

### How will funds be used?

TikTok best practices suggest to have a fresh iPhone with a fresh iCloud account posting exclusively from within the geographic region that’s being targeted (location GPS + IP). Therefore, we’ll need to purchase an iPhone 8 ($300 USD). 

Additionally, the creator will charge approximately $50/video to publish and manage the comments. 

The funds will be used to purchase the hardware (iPhone) & to compensate the creator on a per video basis. 

### How will funds be managed?

Via Utopia. The creator doesn’t have a crypto wallet & has requested fiat. The current plan is for Commodore to pay the creator via a TradFi solution & request reimbursement (with payment confirmation) via Utopia.

**Success Narrative**

March, 12th 2023 — Our fast growing TikTok account is up to 50,000 followers in two short months with our top 3 videos generating 1.5m, 1.1m, & 850k views. We’re beginning to skew the content towards particular teams to start trying to build team affinity with our users. This upcoming Ball Hogs season, we’ll be dropping Ball Hogs highlights to this account to drive awareness for our team. We’re planning on doing another local basketball tournament and seeing what type of traffic we drive to the event via our TikTok account.

In our conversations with ownership groups, they’re interested in how we can convert these fans to becoming fans of their particular team. Additionally, there is excitement about exploring “lite” monetization — one idea is a fan club model but optimized towards Filipino content.

Given the success of this project, we’re preparing to pitch this to OTE & BIG3 to deploy in both the Philippines & Brazil (two fast growing basketball markets).
