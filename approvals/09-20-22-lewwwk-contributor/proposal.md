**### Results from Previous Work**

Through work completed under the previous proposal, Lewwwk, in collaboration with Commodore and Flex, successfully established the capacity for Krause House to secure the capital required to take a minority ownership position in an NBA team.

In addition, a scalable, compliant capital structure and roadmap has been developed that will enable Krause House to make team acquisitions, advance fan ownership and participation, invest in sports innovation, and progressively decentralize ownership. The first component of that roadmap, a $100M acquisition and investment fund has been also be validated as an attractive and differentiated offering to capital allocators who invest in sports.

### Divergence from Previously Intended Outcomes

- Early on in the previous work, effort shifted from higher-volume outreach to collaborating with a few key individuals with deep experience in sports investment and transformation. As a result CRM and contact metrics were deprioritized.
- While we have not secured specific capital commitments, we can confirm meaningful interest in a Krause House treasury diversification round, the inclusion of the venture strategy in Fund I as described above, and the capacity to secure the capital required to take a minority ownership position in an NBA team.

**### What Does Success Look Like**

Outreach to LPs around Fund I is now in process and we stand ready to raise the capital necessary to complete an acquisition in an NBA team that comes available to us. 

Success for this phase of Capital Coordination could look like:

- LOI and capital secured for a minority ownership position in an NBA team.
- First close on Fund I > $20mm
- First fees from Fund I land in Krause House Treasury by end of year.

<aside>
⚠️ Market sentiment continues to be bearish with significant macro uncertainties looming that are beyond our control. While sports remains an attractive investment and we have designed for compliance with existing regulations and practice… outcomes continue to have heightened uncertainties.
