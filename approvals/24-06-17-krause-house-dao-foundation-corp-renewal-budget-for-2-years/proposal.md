### Project Details

As per our [proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/krausehouse.eth/proposal/0xb42d205c91a8cab902f6a16830fb131e8f80605b7c85aeac29704766a9a588be) for an entity creation, Krause House established a foundation & a corporation in Panama. Annually, we owe our vendor Korporatio an amount to renew both. As long as KH is active, then our legal entities should be in good standing.

This proposal is to pay our vendor annually to stay in good standing.
