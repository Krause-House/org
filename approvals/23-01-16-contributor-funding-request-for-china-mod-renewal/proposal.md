- 250 $KRAUSE / month

Paid monthly for 3 months.

Stewardship team may cancel this agreement at any point.

Community may submit a proposal to cancel this agreement at any point.

**### Scope of Work**

tantalum has been the Krause House China mod for the last ~9 months. 

You can review his work in the #chinese-translated channel. He’s been consistently answering questions & making translations as needed. 

**### Specification**

This contributor may submit a request for *up to* the specified amount based on self-assessment of their work.

**### Intention**

This is intended to encourage contributors to take immediate action on a wide range of problems/opportunities, as opposed to proceeding through the slower process of submitting a proposal for a narrow scope of work.

We prefer to invest in and groom talent, giving *them* the freedom and capital they need to be entrepreneurs within our community.  We value self-starters who are able to take action and deliver quality work.

**### bUt SomEb0dY m1gHt t@kE t0o mUçh** Both the community and the Stewardship team has the power to cancel this stream if it is being abused.  In addition, if a contributor abuses this trust, they are effectively burning their social credibility and ability to successfully submit proposals in the future.  We expect some lossiness; however, we believe the benefits of getting good work off the ground is worth this small cost.
