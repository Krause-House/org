2023 Big3 Ball Hogs Budget

Author: itsunclejon#7365

### ELI5 (Explain it Like I’m 5) Project Value-Add

As the "owners" of the Big3 Ball Hogs, Krause House aims to continue scaling up operations for everyone's favorite fan section, "The Pig Pen". Additionally, they plan to partner with AIFS to host court refurbishments and locally run 3x3 fan activations in Big3 tour cities. The goal is to demonstrate to NBA front offices why fractionalized ownership is the future and how decentralized communities can deliver tangible results.

### Requested Budget:

- 60000 USDT

### How will funds be used?

- $15,000 - Travel (Flights, Hotels, Vehicle Rental, Gas)
    - Last year’s travel budget was around $14.5k. I was learning efficient travel on the fly so this summer the process will be streamlined and more cost effective.
- $8,000 - Tailgate Activation Supplies
    - We have the following left over from last year
        - P.A. System
        - Posterboard
        - Paint supplies
        - Coolers
    - What we need this year
        - A new basketball hoop (aiming for a cheap & portable one just for tailgate attendees to shoot around on)
        - Weekly beverages for attendees
        - Weekly entertainment (local DJ or music)
- $5,000 - Engagement Assistant Bounty
    - There are 8 tour cities and I need 4 assistants to help with operations throughout the day. I’ll be paying each of them $125
- $5,000 - Pig Pen In-Game Supplies
    - New Buckets
    - Drumsticks for buckets
    - New Banner(s)
    - T-shirts to throw to Pig Pen members
- $10,000 - Non-Profit and AAU Event supplies
    - Our main focus here is the Big3 jamboree in NYC
    - Here is the [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rRWw-EAn-CpRUrt-MRKcL1DCxEDBISiZjzSB7HSe_fY/edit?usp=sharing) to the planning doc that is being authored by @Mario Lopes, Evette Morales (hoops instructor), and myself. It’s bare bones for now, but will be built out further
- $12,000 - Krause House Jerry Bounty
    - I’d love to REALLY tap into the community for initiatives this summer this ranges from
        - Social Media Videos
        - Analytics
        - Non-Profit Outreach and Connections
        - General Week to week planning
    - On the main Ball Hogs Notion page, i will link a Excel sheet for these bounties as they come up.

These spending categories are just an estimate and subject to change. There is also an effort being made to fundraise extra money through sponsorship and advertisements, particularly for the NYC event

### How will funds be managed?

Funds will be managed through a multi-sig to be set up after possible passing. The multi-sig will require 3/5 signatures from any of the following

### Team

- Uncle Jon
- Mario
- Commodore
- D-Luxe
- Crabtree

### Project Details

Goal: **Demonstrate the value of fractional ownership**

Tactics:

- Efficiently distribute Courtside/VIP tickets to Jerrys
- Target VIP guests and partners for any remaining tickets
- Aim to form partnerships with local non-profits and AAU teams to fill the GA “Pig Pen” with members of these communities.

Outcomes:

- 100% Claim of courtside tickets
- 66% claim of VIP tickets
- 85% claim of GA tickets

Goal: **Win over Big3 audiences by having best-in-class IRL fan activations**

Tactics:

- The Pig Pen (in game)
- Tailgate Activities (Outside of stadium pre-game and post-game)
- Community Activations (The day prior to Ball Hogs game)

Outcomes:

- During games, the Ball Hogs have a noticeable representation of fanhood
- Fans are engaged from the time they roll into the stadium and we create excitement for all game attendees
- We give back to communities either tangibly (court refurbs and community service) or experimentally (basketball clinics, 3x3 games)

Goal: **Demonstrate the value of decentralized content creation**

Tactics:

- Create a content capture and sharing mechanism (likely through Mochi) to generate buzz about the Pig Pen on social media.
- Designate 1 or 2 people within the DAO to monitor and post on all Ball Hogs social media

Outcomes:

- Generate an ever-expanding pool of social media ready media to be easily accessible by members of KH
- Grow the Ball Hogs social media following by at least 2x over the course of the season
- By using some of our influencer partners (In the Lab, Joy DeAngela, Evette Morales, and the Bone Collector) we would have built in methods to boost viewership likelihood.

### Notion Database

I have made a public facing Notion database that can be viewed [here](https://www.notion.so/Ball-Hogs-2023-Dashboard-81e04be766584fc98c7d30f15cb2fc03). I’d encourage anyone looking to get involved or seeking transparency around projects to give it a peep.
