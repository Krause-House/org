### Project Details

After expressing interest to Bayesian when his stream launched, he and I met and collaborated on the type of content we want to produce. Our game plan is to produce consistent content weekly around happenings in the NBA. I’ve been learning the Adobe Suite over the past year or so and will be using that to produce unique content to bring awareness via social media to our brand. We produced our first video this past weekend and uploaded it to our socials.
