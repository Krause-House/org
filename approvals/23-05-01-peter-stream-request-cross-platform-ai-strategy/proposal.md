### ELI5 (Explain it Like Iâ€™m 5) Project Value-Add

Requesting funding for April (partial month), May, June, and July to continue developing Krause House's custom AI products using large language models. Shifting focus from a custom-built platform to backend AI-basketball systems development in order to create an outwardly publishable media brand, currently named Jerry's Corner. Jerry's Corner aspires to revolutionize media distribution through innovative software development, utilizing advanced AI, composable technology, and real-time NBA stats and fan reactions to create dynamic, engaging content for Krause House across multiple platforms. Seamlessly integrating various distribution strategies with a unique, consistent personality, this project redefines content consumption while fostering a deeper connection between Krause House and its fans, transcending traditional media boundaries.

### Requested Budget Stream

- Up to $2,000 USDC and 2,000 Krause, payable at the end of April (for work done in April)
- Up to $6,500 USDC and 6,500 Krause per month, payable at the end of May, June, and July

### Stream Payment Accountability Metric

To ensure accountability throughout the project, I propose a variable compensation based on performance indicators. 3-5 high context members will rate my performance on the criteria above using a scale of 1-10. The rating level will determine by compensation level by apply the rating as a percentage to the maximum compensation level.

### **Evaluation Criteria**

1. Outward Media Quantity and Quality:
    - Rate the increase in the quantity and quality of outward media on a scale of 1-10 (1 being ineffective, 10 being highly effective).
2. Development of Platform-Specific Strategies:
    - Rate the effectiveness of the developed strategies for each platform on a scale of 1-10 (1 being ineffective, 10 being highly effective).
3. Real-Time Engagement and Responsiveness:
    - Rate the success of real-time engagement with fans and responsiveness to live basketball events on a scale of 1-10 (1 being ineffective, 10 being highly effective).
4. Overall Stream Impact on Krause House Visibility and Engagement:
    - Rate the overall impact of the stream on contributing to Krause House's growth, visibility, and engagement on a scale of 1-10 (1 being ineffective, 10 being highly effective).

### **Protections**

- Stewardship team may cancel this agreement at any point.
- Community may submit a proposal to cancel this agreement at any point.

### Previous Project Details

As of today, my previous Krause-funded project successfully created the following: a Jerry chatbot with a jailbroken model, dynamic visual outputs, and integrated both quantitative and qualitative information through dynamic API calls, resulting from complex natural language parsing of user messages. A demo can be found here: [https://box-score.peterbergin.repl.co](https://box-score.peterbergin.repl.co/)

Furthermore, I have initiated the development of a ChatGPT plugin featuring similar functionality to the aforementioned application.

I also tested an early version of a Twitter bot capable of understanding current NBA playoff games and producing outward media. This test serves as a proof of concept for the proposed project direction and was published on my personal [Twitter account @peterjbergin](https://twitter.com/peterjbergin) (where you can view the tweets). Tweets were automatically generated through dynamic dataflows on April 24th to 27th as a quick assessment of reach and functionality. The test demonstrated both the ability to generate topical tweets and increase engagement by live-tweeting about relevant game events, all without any human intervention.

Here are some key data points from the experiment:

- Personal follower count: 197
- Tweets generated: 62
- Total Impressions: 6240
- Average Impressions: 100.6
- Max impressions: 223

Please note that these numbers may not accurately represent potential engagement, as my account is not solely followed by basketball fans. The content is not tailored to my direct followers and would likely be viewed mainly by non-followers.

### Project Details

The proposed project, currently named Jerry's Corner (name pending), aims to create a consistent, branded media distribution strategy across various social platforms and distribution channels by leveraging the highly composable nature of the technology. This strategy includes utilizing Twitter and newsletters for written content; TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram for video content; and all podcast platforms for voice content. Featuring a unique personality and a consistent voice across all channels, the project seeks to maximize engagement and reach for Krause House.

The rationale for using multiple platforms and distribution angles is the inherent composability of the backend technology. Developing one distribution angle enhances the next. This project involves creating data flows, building models to analyze fan-generated qualitative data, and constructing autonomous AI agents to generate and find data, which helps improve the overall quality across all platforms.

Although numerous platforms are listed, the project will focus on developing a specific distribution strategy for each platform sequentially. The order may change as needed, but the current plan is as follows:

1. Develop a Twitter bot to tweet about live games, respond to popular tweets, and discuss trending NBA topics, as an NBA analyst would. This lays the groundwork for short-form text generation. As demonstrated above, this work is nearly complete.
2. Develop video flows for short-form vertical videos to be posted on TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram.
3. Develop conversational bot abilities through direct messaging capabilities of social platforms, similar to the custom platform built (see above), but using social platforms as the user interface.
4. Develop long-form written content about the NBA to be published on Twitter and as an email newsletter.
5. Develop a short or long-form podcast distribution strategy to be published using text-to-voice AI software.

As these strategies are developed, there will be a major focus on maintaining and improving existing automated distribution flows based on engagement and impressions data. The composable nature of this technology allows for the creation of a dynamic media distribution system featuring our own KH personality, Jerry.

This project offers multiple benefits: it allows me to explore the creativity of building a software-based product with LLMs, increases distribution and engagement for Krause House across multiple mediums (5k impressions in a small-scale test), showcases KH talent through dynamically engaging fans with real-time live basketball media, and enables us to pursue the highest potential value approach.

### **Mention of additional project in KH**

In my performance-based compensation structure, I mentioned potential work for KH not directly related to this project. This could involve assisting efforts in the DIO to improve operations, as I have done previously and as will be needed in the near future. Additionally, it could include side projects such as helping build AI-based bots for KH onboarding, governance, and more, which have been recently workshopped.

### Leadership Position: Strengthening Teamwork and Participation

If this proposal is approved, I will take on a leadership role to enhance teamwork and encourage active involvement from all members. In the past, many of our projects have been carried out in silos, which has limited our ability to work together and share ideas. To address this, I plan to promote open communication and cooperation among all participants and establish connections with other funded projects to explore synergies and collaborative opportunities.

My goal is to establish a clear and accessible way for everyone to contribute their thoughts and skills to the project. By working together, we can combine our strengths and achieve better results than we would by working alone.

In short, as a leader, I will focus on building a collaborative environment where each person's voice is valued and their contributions are recognized. Through teamwork and participation, we can move our project forward and reach our shared objectives.

### **Voting Options and Determination**

1. Approve
2. Against
