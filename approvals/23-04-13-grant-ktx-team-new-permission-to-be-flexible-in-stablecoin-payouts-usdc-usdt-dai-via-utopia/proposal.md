### ELI5 (Explain it Like Iâ€™m 5)

USDC was widely considered the most stable of the stablecoins. We had 100% of our stablecoin allocation in USDC. Banks collapsing made USDC dip significantly in value, emergency treasury management actions were taken to save the treasury. We now have a blend of USDC, USDT, & DAI. For all intents & purposes, these stablecoins are all roughly the same; each with their unique pros & cons. 

This proposal is to grant a new permission the kTX team processing payments via Utopia to send out payouts in a stablecoin of their choice.

### Why make a proposal for this?

Each proposal that requests stablecoins, has historically been written to request USDC. In practice, the author typically is implying a stablecoin pegged at $1 USD rather than the technical request of the USDC token.

Now that our treasury is more diverse, it will be more cost effective to manage the treasury diversification against the goal of stabilizing the treasury rather than catering to a governance technicality of paying in USDC. 

Said differently, the spirit is to pay a stablecoin pegged at ~$1.00 USD.
