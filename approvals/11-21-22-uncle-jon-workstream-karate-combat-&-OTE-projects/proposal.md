### ELI5 (Explain it Like I’m 5) Project Value-Add

- Krause House has recently begun working with [Karate Combat](https://www.karate.com/) and [Overtime Elite Basketball](https://www.overtimeelite.com/) on digital fan engagement. This proposal is to nominate Uncle Jon as the Jerry who would lead our work efforts on their projects.

---

### Requested Budget:

- 7,000 USDC sent to Uncle Jon as up-front payment
- 250 USDC sent upon completion of podcast episodes (per episode)
- 1,000 USDC set aside for discretionary spending for travel, accommodations, and supplies
- 2500 $KRAUSE upon completion of stream

### Why these amounts?

- Karate Combat is paying $4000 USDC (3,000 one-time + 250 per episode for 5 episodes)
    - Note: KH retains 90% of all revenue generated via the podcast (sponsorships)
- Overtime Elite is paying $5000 USDC (per month)
- 250 USD per podcast episode produced (total of 5 episodes for this “phase”)

### How will funds be managed?

Funds will be distributed as requested via Utopia within the allowed budgets listed above. The amounts that are paid from OTE & Karate Combat will 100% pass through to the contributors working on the projects. At the current moment, Uncle Jon is the sole contributor on these two projects. We are expecting some additional help on things such as podcast editing.

1. Uncle Jon will act as team lead (and potentially sole member) and submit requests to Utopia.
2. Upfront funding to Uncle Jon at 0x2D5803Cb5Cb2Bd90eb242e0162AE5E25B7a31b39

# Collaboration Project Details

## Karate Combat

Karate Combat has tapped Krause House to help build out their newly formed DAO. They are a full contact fighting league that is looking to increase their internal Discord engagement. Our scope of work for them is as follows:

Concept

- As a pre-curser to the upcoming $KARATE token drop and the KC37 fight event on December 17th, 2022, Krause House looks to assist in creating audio assets in the form of a “Hard Knocks” style documentary podcast.
- The podcast will follow along 2 different narratives, it will feature members of the Karate Combat community to highlight internal storylines within the DAO and it will also serve as a way to get in-depth and personal with the fighters on the upcoming fight bill for #KC37
- Karate Combat DAO Storyline
    - Since the DAO is in it’s beginning stages, the goal here is to incentivize those curious or inactive in the DAO to become a more involved part of the community and increase engagement.
    - The first few episodes will be a relaxed conversation with KC DAO leaders, mostly shooting the shit, with a little backstory into how the decision to turn the league into a DAO came about and the hopeful benefits of the initiative
    - In addition, we’ll dedicate additional episodes for chatting with some of the hosts and influencers involved in announcing the events.
    - Have 1-2 episodes highlighting discord members and having them discuss their love for combat sports and personal stories.
- #KC37-38 Storyline
    - Something we have taken deep notice of is the amount of camaraderie and respect between the fighters on any given week. We’d love to use existing audio from video assets and combine them with sit down interviews between the two fighters facing off and Uncle Jon.
    - The conversation will be lighthearted and a chance to continue the vibe of respect within this league.
    - Current DAO/Discord members who are heavily involved will enter a pool (or just be selected) to co-host the fighter podcast. The setting for this will be an informal Rogan-esque conversation.

Objectives

- Significantly increase engagement and activity in the Discord channel.
- Aside from the obvious financial incentives, fans will now have established relationship incentives.
- Over the course of the next 5-6 months, we hope to deeply personify the DAO to a collaborative community made up of fans, fighters, influencers, and executives.
- Successfully “tee up” a master plan to include this audio content as part of the “Up Only Gaming” process

## Overtime Elite Basketball

Overtime Elite has noticed our communities efforts in the Big3 and other fan related projects. They want us to spitball and try different initiatives to create a first-in-class digital fan experience with a few possible IRL activities involved. Some initial project ideas aaaaaaarrrreeee…

- Create and manage a discord server for the YNG Dreamerz

**********************************************************Activities within the Discord**********************************************************

### **NBA Trivia Night**

---

**Context**

We have been running a trivia night in our own Discord with community members and it has been a huge success. This trivia would mostly be NBA related questions and as we generate more dedicated fandom around the YNG Dreamers, questions will start to be more relevant to OTE players and highlights

**Goals & Key Performance Indicators**

| Goals | KPIs |
| --- | --- |
| High Engagement | Total # of participants |
| Strong Retention | % increase session-to-session |

**Dependencies**

- Access to some merch for giveaways
- Guest appearances from players from the Dreamerz roster

### **Dreamers Presser/Town Hall**

---

**Context**

- Before each Dreamers game, we’d like to scale out a fan-run press conference and/or town hall between the members and coaches/players. As camaraderie forms within the community between members of the organization and fans, this will begin to feel like an intimate discussion around the game.

**Goals & Key Performance Indicators**

| Goals | KPIs |
| --- | --- |
| Increased familiarity between Dreamers & Community members | Increased activity in Discord channels |
| High engagement during digital activations | Number of questions asked by community members |

**Literally Show & Tell**

---

- This could happen weekly or bi-weekly. We would hold online registration open to all members of the Discord. They would each have roughly 5 minutes to show and tell a cherished item

**Goals & Key Performance Indicators**

| Goals | KPIs |
| --- | --- |
| Higher camaraderie between members | Scaled increase in Discord chat activity |
| For people to have fun | Full registration for every event |

**Fan Spotlight Video**

---

- Each Monday, Wednesday, or Friday we would release a 10 minute sit down casual chit chat between Uncle Jon and a member of the online community. These “guests” would be selected based off their engagement in the community, selected members/guests would be sent a small “dreamer package” containing some kind of small merch.
- Room to potentially scale to a dedicated “fan experience” for the featured fan with game tickets if local

**Goals & Key Performance Indicators**

| Goals | KPIs |
| --- | --- |
| Increase cross-fan collaboration and dialogue | Number of comments and reactions after each fan spotlight |
| Boost visibility of highly engaged fans | Number of view of fan spotlight |

**Individualized Player Server Channels**

- I’m not entirely sure what this would look like but as we (KH) form relationships with players and coaches I’d love to keep a keen ear open to their own personal interests outside of basketball. Whether thats music, movies, gaming, etc. I think each player having a platform to generate their own rapport with fans is important to generating emotional buy-in of team support. This effort would be scaled, but I think it’s vitally important.

**Goals & Key Performance Indicators**

| Goals | KPIs |
| --- | --- |
| Increased player engagement within the community | Players and staff coming forward with their own creative contributions for the community |
| Have internal Discord members be highly involved in their favorite players projects (possible crossover into web3 NFT’s) | High viewership and reactions for each project released |
